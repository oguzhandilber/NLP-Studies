"1","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Overpriced dissapointment","Dull taste. High price. No finish. Over-hyped and disappointing."
"2","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Delicious","Delicious! sugared red fruits and sweet with a morish, cinnamon, aromatic depth."
"3","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Good for beginners. i know cos i am a beginner","I am not a whisky expert but i really love the taste. The experience i had i would describe as very comfortable like being snug under a blanket on a cold rainy day. i sip this with my friend through the night and just enjoyed the flavors. That being said, it is more expensive and i feel that for that price, you could get a better whisky. i am not saying this because of the no age but rather, i think you can get more from other scotch for that price. But if you have it in your vault already, its really enjoyable."
"4","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Yamazaki Tutorial","This is a terrible Yamazaki.  Very young, unsherried, no finish.  The Yamazaki 12 is slightly better.  The new Hibiki NAS ""Harmony"" is still better and a better value than the Yamazaki 12.  The Limited Edition Yamazakis brought out each year are good value and an excellent every day dram. The Yamazaki 18 is a very good sherry bomb, unfortunately insanely over-priced.  Yamazaki Sherry Cask is one of great bottles, difficult to obtain.  The Yamazaki 25 is in a world of it's own and bears no relation to any of the others.  It is one of the greatest whisky expressions ever created."
"5","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Very Nice","First time and I like it - fresh but not thin and a sweet depth to it. I know I like a whisky when I can't stop smelling the empty glass!"
"6","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Unworthy of al the hype over Yamazaki","I can’t believe all these commenters who are fawning over this particular reserve. Are they for real? This whisky is nonsensical for its price and unworthy of all the hype that Yamazaki or singke malts have been getting. It’s so coarse it’s doesn’t seem very far removed from lab-grade alcohol. The distiller should never have released this (or do they take their customers for fools?). Disappointment."
"7","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Japanese Yamasaki better than one made somewhere .","My friend brought bottle of this from Japan in 2014-2015 and wes so good. And I haven’t  tried anything better since."
"8","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Delicious. ","Nice. I like some vanilla and this has the goods. "
"9","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Yamazaki Distiller's Reserve","Stands against Glenfiddich 12 in it's similarities. I think this is nicer, but I'm not sure if that's worth the price difference."
"10","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Can't Wait","Recommended by my friend."
"11","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Not the Best, but No means the Worst","As as good as the hype would have you believe. It's still a very good whisky and something i would buy again. But i did not get much of the fruity tastes i expected. you can taste a faint trace of coconut, but only if you look real hard for it. "
"12","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Amazing!","If this is ""far cry of Yamazaki 12"" as some describe it, then Yamazaki 12 well better be the nectar of gods. This one is amazing. If you try it in proper tasting glass, it's worth its price for the nose alone. Brilliant balance of fruit, nuts and oak (fruits are more apparent). Palate is sweet, a bit spicy with a little burn, but nothing to spoil the pleasure. Finish is long and smooth, with pleasant spice at the end. Truly delicious and definitely on the list of my favourites now. "
"13","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","I will love to have this. ","Recommended by my friend. "
"14","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","disappointing ","rather disappointing. can't really taste what I should, it is rather flat with alcohol and oak, doesn't really improve with water, with (melting) ice dilutes too much. it just zastes like a cheap whisky. suntory is generally overpriced, this one especially. a 12yo glenfiddich for 30€ is better, and this is not a compliment. think, I will buy soda and try highballing it, which normally not my way of drinking whisky."
"15","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Overrated Yamasaki ","Strong alcohol smell, by added water & lift out the alcohol a very young whiskey . Sweet pear flavor, fresh not too long lasting end note. "
"16","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Good Job!","Is the only version of Yamazaki that I have tried, and one of the best single malts I ever tasted, behind from the discontinued Miyagikyo 10, and with a place among the places where are Glengoyne, Arran, Glendronach, etc. This yamazaki has a good malt taste, complemented with several flavors that I'm not able to distinguish but is delicious and with a medium finish and a bit of effervescence that I love. Good job Yamazaki."
"17","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - NAS","No ""aged 12 years"" on the box, so this is the replacement NAS.There are some tasting notes on the box and kinda get a bit of that, however I also have a small amount of the 12yo from a few years ago, and there is much difference in nose and taste. The age statement bottle has some very heady notes as if there where sherry barrels in the mix. Those notes are missing from the NAS. So I agree with the other comments - it is not comparable to the 12 yo. "
"18","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","No year mentioned ","Just got one and have to say very nice "
"19","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Quality!","I have never tried the Yamazaki 12, but if people say its better than this one then...HOLY COW!  the 12 must be amazing, because I really think this is a quality quality whisky.Love the sweet nose and very fruity palate.  Absolutely lovely palate actually.   Finish is decent, wait...what am I saying, the finish is excellent and very spicy.  Very nice."
"20","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Yamazaki","One of the best "
"21","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Like a Yamazaki 12 but really rough around the edges.","I was excited to try this as I found a healthy supply at my local. It's nowhere near as smooth and balanced as the 12. Not bad for the money, but for a little bit more, the Yamazaki 12 is certainly worth the extra money."
"22","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Rajiv jaggi","An amazing whiskey with better essence and smoothnes to the skylimits"
"23","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Just delicious","Very subtle beautiful flavors and the cedar/sandalwood note really flips my switch."
"24","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","WOW!","Nose: Violet, Cookie dough, fruit, malt and saltyPalate: licorice, violet candy, spicy, a little seasaltI'm in love! Forgot to add that I've tasted this in february, the falvour may have changed?"
"25","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","WOW!","Nose: Violet, Cookie dough, fruit, malt and saltyPalate: licorice, violet candy, spicy, a little seasaltI'm in love!The Yamazaki 12 year old on the other hand? there's no way I would buy that again over this!You feel the alcohol to much on the 12 year for some odd kind? and it's not even near as tasy as these others are."
"26","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Garbage","Yamazaki makes great whisky, this is not one. Haven't tried it in a high ball yet but I feel it may be what I resort too. A far cry from the 12 and 18 year"
"27","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Can we stop kidding ourselves?","Look, Yamazaki makes some amazing whiskey. This is not one of them."
"28","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Barely drinkable ","Have tried NAS from Yoichi, Taketsuru, Miyagikyo and this one. I like this one the least. Def for highball"
"29","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Great","Great Whiskey."
"30","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Okay","To me, a 9-10 rating would categorize a whiskey as ""classic"" and 7-8 as ""excellent"".  While this is a great whiskey, I can not and will not classify this as classic.  I will say that the description is relatively accurate in terms of flavor profile, but could be a bit misleading.  This is a very smooth drink and the layers of flavor are very subtle. The oak dominates the palate and I would describe the berry component as gentle not ""lively"".  "

"32","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Lovely","Great whisky - nice sherry and complexity"
"33","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Worst Yamazaki I had Yet","I have had the 12 and 18 and this one is very disappointing "
"34","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Great","Very good and high quality whisky"
"35","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Pull your head out of your Hind Quarters","It's good for the price but it's only relative in taste.  There is more psychology behind the nose and palate.  Everyone is hopping on the bandwagon putting his/her nose further up the rear of the person who commented before them.  It's a good solid dram but nothing near amazing.   The Yama 12 is far more complex to me but a good friend of mine from Japan just chuckles when I talk about it.  She says there is stuff out there that even Jim Murray himself can't grasp.  Heavy!!!"
"36","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Bought a bottle of this candy","So fucking good!"
"37","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","The GTR ","So smooth. So silky and loads going on."
"38","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Yummie","French, Japanese and Spanish oak makes a subtle, fruity and quite a complex dram"
"39","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","A Very Nice Whisky","When we have such great whiskys here from Scotland or Ireland, I don't tend to drink whiskys from abroad. This one was recommended by a friend.I was actually taken back by how good this whisky is.Very spicy, refreshing yet smooth whisky that leaves a sweet trace of fruit on the palate coupled with the complexity of spices which leaves a very satisfying taste that lingers.A very good whisky. If you don't normally venture for whiskys from around the world, then I would recommend trying this one, it is a very good dram."
"40","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","An amazing whiskey","I don't know anything  about whiskey. we went to Japan in 2014 to visit my wife Family. in our flight to come back in USA we went to the duty free and bought this whiskey. Few days later we try it and I was like wouaaa this is very good!!! I didn't that Japan was so good in Whiskey. The funny thing is that this whiskey was elected whiskey of the yer 2014."
"41","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","New to whisky ","I'm new to whisky and just discovering what I like. On hearing a look about Japanese whisky I had to try one. And I seem to have tried the right one too. Great price and what a taste. Seem to be the one I'm judging all other whisky so by. Love the flavour just keeps on giving. Although There are a lot more wiskys to try. "
"42","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Good bang for buck","The one bad thing about Japanese whiskies is they're all becoming cost prohibitive. This is almost as good as the Yamazaki 12yo but 3/4 the price.The tasting notes listed at the top are pretty accurate (I smelt cherries as well though - yum!)The finish, while clean & crisp like many Japanese whiskies, is maybe a bit more ""spicy"" than what I'd like but I assume that's because it's younger whisky.Good value if you can't afford a Hibiki 12/17yo or Yamazaki 12yo."
"43","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Fyi...","This is one of the most commonly used whiskies in Japan for highballs. Nothing special on its own but nice as a highball on a hot summers day."
"44","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Delightul","Simply an amazing whisky.  Please add a few drops of water or a small ice cube. It is transformative....wow."
"45","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","this is the one","Extremely smooth yet deep, rich aromas. Very good and the price is right."
"46","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","phenomenal whisky","better than I expected it to be. Just by hearing what was in this bottle had me excited enough to be underwhelmed but I was still blown away by the complexity in flavor, and amazingly smooth finish. For the price this is a steal"
"47","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","excellent","excellent"
"48","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Stunningly good! ","Thought I'd made a huge mistake with first few glasses as this really packs a full punch.. However for the first time ever I added a few drops of water and wow! Blew my palate with how it opened up a whirl of complex tastes -  this is seriously good malt whisky which has opened my eyes to a whole new world of options, and my glass to those few drops of water I never thought would ever touch the sides of my whisky glasses..... "
"49","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Depressingly good whisky!","I received a bottle of this from my son for Christmas.Giving me, a Jock, a Japanese whisky? Obviously taking the piss!  That evening, after enjoying a Glenfiddich and Glenmorangie I said ""Lets try your Yamazaki"" or words to that effect.Well, there's no point denying it, this is a seriously good whisky.The richness and complexity blows my staple diet to smithereens!Now I'm no expert, but I did not detected a hint of ""strawberries"", ""rasperries"" and definately not ""coconut"" though there is a smooth sweetness there, and this is certainly a bloody good whisky.Thankfully the balance of the universe was restored when I opened my single cask, first oak filled, 30 year old MacAllan. WOW! Another world. "
"50","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Marvellous stuff","I'm a big fan of Japanese whisky. I first tried this at the Yamazaki distillery just outside Kyoto. It would seem it is replacing the 10 and 12 year olds which is fine by me. It's better than both of them. My only problem is that it costs nearly twice as much here as it does in Japan!"
"51","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","A MUST HAVE","This is a must have... For 70 US, it's worth every penny... Thank God I got this before they sold out, just wish I bought more. This actually compares to some of the 150 plus dollar a bottle malts I've had over the years. Each glass seems to have varied notes and seem to get better with each glass."
"52","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Exquisite","Wanted to try the Yamazaki 12. Asked a friend to get this from Singapore (since it's not easily available in Dubai) and what he got me was the Distiller's Reserve. Having tried the 12 before, this one came across as a very pleasant surprise. It is rich and textured, quite deep as a single malt and its fruitiness and redolence of varied casks comes across post a couple of tastings. Which makes it quite layered. Especially loved the finish of this, which is exquisite in its mouthfeel. Small tip: It actually tastes better with a single small ice cube and around 4-5 small splashes of cold water. Enjoy this if you love a deep, rich whiskey. Slainthe, Shantesh"
"53","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","spot on","Beautiful, seriously good dropThat nose is inticing.With each swallow,follows a smile.Hardest part is saying goodnight to it.Great value, Steve Mcgiff st. Ives cornwall"
"54","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Growing on me steadily","A gift from a friend & my first Japanese whisky and my first impression was nice and smooth but something missing at the heart of it. Repeated tastings however have me more and more intrigued. I like a dram that keeps up the surprises. Incredibly well balanced and one of the smoothest malts I've had."
"55","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Lovely","put a bottle of this out at my wedding after picking it up at sainsburys for around £40. it was one I the most popular whiskys by far with loads of people asking me the next day to remind them what it was.Nice fruity flavours with a good finish. I've gone and bought myself a bottle as there was none left after the wedding!"
"56","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Delicious","Picked this up in sainsbury's of all places for £42 (not even on offer). It really is tasty and great value for the money. My first experience of Japanese whisky, and at this rate definitely not my last. As it happened they also had the hakashu distiller's reserve so might have to give that a go as well as I am a fan of a bit of smoke!"
"57","The Yamazaki Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Yamazaki","Showing off. . . ","I had a glass of this over the weekend. The best whisky in its price bracket, it's soft on the palette, complex, silky. Those who love the Hibiki range should jump on this . . . "
"58","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","The Great Japanese Whisky","I love Scotch Whisky but after have these Japanese Whisky (Yamazaki 12 / Hibiki 12 / Hibiki 17) the taste so Complexity than the Scotch. I'm wondering why they're all Sold Out  quickly  in Australia"
"59","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Great Japanese Whisky","I love scotch whisky but they're not complexity like Japanese Whisky ( Yamazaki 12 / Hibiki 12 etc... ) now I'm wondering why all these Japanese Whisky Sold out quickly the whole worldwide"
"60","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","A good one.","A realy good experience. Sold out in Norway, had to go to Sweden to get it.Worth the trip."
"61","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Good, not great, for price","Good, but not any better than the rest of the pack in the price range. There are in every good liquor store several scotches in the same price range, at least a couple of which will be better than the Yamazaki. That said, it is a good whisky, enjoyable to the nose and the palate. It lacks just a bit of fullness, however, necessary to move toward the front of the class."
"62","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Excellent","Excellent Enjoyed it a lot  but it has become too expensive."
"63","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Decent, but not for its price range ","Simply doesn’t have the depth and range of flavor as most Japanese whiskies in the 75-125 price range. If you’re looking to try something new and have had all the others, it’s probably worth giving it a shot. But if you’re considering other Japanese whiskeys around 100, almost anything on that list would likely be more dynamic. "
"64","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Thinking outside the box exotic!!!!","The best of the best   Never blend in be different "
"65","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","The best whisky I have ever tasted.","The best whisky I have ever tasted. My favorite by far."
"66","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","worth EVERY cent","Recently was introduced to this beauty and I must say, it does not disappoint! I originally thought Id try it and move on, Now I make sure to keep it in my cabinets. Quickly became a favorite of mine after just a few glasses."
"67","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Perf","Best"
"68","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Superb!","Awesome! I wish it cost as much as it used to ($60-$70 USD circa 2015). The media and hype (maybe justified?) has brought the price much higher these days. Very similar taste to the 18, although a bit more rough but not by much. Wondering if it was worth it to purchase the Yamazaki 18....Very balanced and rich. Full body, rich flavors, hint of vanilla, floral, nuts, and a tinge of spice. I wish it was kept a secret before the ratings..."
"69","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Beautiful, superb.....","I only pour a tot on special occasions... I'm sadly running out of the nectar !!!!"
"70","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Superb","It is an enlightenment libation."
"71","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Good but expensive","Excellent exotic whisky"
"72","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","must have","Excellent exotic whisky"
"73","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Is just the hype","Gents, at this price? Think how many great 18, and 21 year old scotch can you get at this price range. I try this 12 and the reserve. Neither one impress me, so I'm out, at list of this one. "
"74","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Expensive though","Nice "
"75","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","overrated","Japanese whiskies are overrated "
"76","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","OK at best","In my opinion, this is overpriced and overrated. I found it very nutty, oily and oaky. I did not find tropical fruits. I found oranges but the nutty and oakiness just overpower it. "
"77","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Delicious but price has sky rocketed ","First, let me say that when handed this I was shocked as to how good it was.  It was full bodied and flavored and tasted deeper than the average many 15 year olds.  But the pricing model has made it not-affordable.  Just a few years ago this could be found in NY for $40 and in CA for $30.  Even in 2016, around $60 in NY - suddenly, the price has shot up and is selling at crazy numbers.  I can't imagine that the average scotch drinkers can afford this anymore and they won't be losing market share.  Which is too bad.  "
"78","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","A Must to have ","I had it a taste of it recently during a stay in Hiroshima , brilliant Malt , I liked it's sweet palate ,soft fruits and the smoky taste . The price was good too at about 5€ a generous  one ."
"79","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Superb 12 yr old","Sampled it last month in a hotel in Kyoto at 500 yen a glass about £3.70 GBP (serious measure too !!) superb whisky and at an unbelievable price !"
"80","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Unique","The best Whisky Ive ever had!"
"81","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Love it ","Lived next to distillery "
"82","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Absolutely amazing!","Amazing!"
"83","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Good, not outstanding. Far too expensive.","Had a bottle of this a few years ago at a much more reasonable price and thought it was good.Now, I've been lucky enough to have been given another and thought I'd review it...If it cost the same as some standard issue Scottish 10-14 year old whiskies then I would say it's decent offering but for me it's no way near as good as the much more subtle yet elegantly satisfying Hakushu Distiller's Reserve. Good appealing nose, nice unimposing, sightly sweet flavour but slightly too much burn and nothing particularly interesting coming through.To me, it's overpriced fairly decent generic whisky."
"84","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Senior John","Most beautiful whisky"
"85","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Yamazaki 12yr","Excellent and smooth whiskey.  Definitely one of my favorites. Wish one day I'll get a chance to try the 18yr & the sherry cask!!"
"86","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Yamazaki 12","Japansk single malt som luktar citrus, blommig karaktär av det bättre slaget, sälta samt lätt doft av tropiska frukter.I överlag måste jag säga att jag blev ganska besviken med tanke på vad jag tyckte om distiller’s reserve så förväntningarna var höga men helt klart godkänd doft i alla fall! (den här luktar mer åt det maltiga hållet)Smak: Blev chokad över hur spritig den var, inte det värsta jag känt men hade räknat med noll?! Kryddig i smaken och en ganska god eftersmak av tropiska frukter som dör av ganska snabbt. Blir diss på denna!"
"87","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","It's sold out...... Says it all!!","Really is excellent. My wife searched for a bottle for me for quite some time before finally getting a bottle from Master of Malt. It's not in stock often and is hard to get any where else. There is a reason for that. Get a bottle when you can you won't be disappointed!!!!"
"88","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Rated this time","Sorry, forgot to include the rating in my first review. Tasted this at the distillery along with several Hakushu and the Yamazaki 18 and 35 year (and the of the dial Sherry Cask, which I did see for sale at several thousand dollars the bottle). The Yamazaki 12 year is the best single I can afford, not quite the complete package that the 18 year is. Some of my companions preferred The Hakushu 12 year. Even the distillery is no longer selling these, but I tracked some of both down in a larger outlet in Kyoto (who also had the aforementioned bottle of Sherry Cask), so worth searching if you want some at less than museum exhibit prices."
"89","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","One of the best","Visited the Yamazaki distillery, tried a number of offerings including 35 year and the amazing Sherry cask. The 12 year is not quite the complete package that the 18 year is, but the best single malt I can afford. BTW at the time of writing you could no longer get the 12 year, even at the distillery, but I tracked down a few bottles at a larger outlet in Kyoto at a price I was ok with, brought them home along with a couple of The Hakushu 12 year, that some of my fellow tasters at the distillery felt was superior. Will do a bit of sampling once I'm over the jet lag."
"90","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Craig ","Received as a birthday gift from my wife and I must say it is truly amazing one of the best i have tried "
"91","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Dry and smoky","I've had a chance to try a number of Suntory whiskies, Yamazaki 18 and 12 years old being among them, and, reluctantly, I have to say most of their expressions feature a slightly smoky palate with an incredibly oaky and dry finish. I had been expecting a more profound experience, but having tasted the 12 year old Yamazaki, I'm not sure it is capable of giving decent, oaky Scottish malts a run for their money. The price tag certainly makes me lean more towards bottlings such as the 12 YO Edradour or the 12 YO Cardhu."
"92","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","The best drink i ever tried.","The best, mmm love it, smooth, delicious, with charakter."
"93","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing ","This is truly a treat! Nose is off the charts.  Fruit,  caramel.  Flavor is just as amazing.  A must have. "
"94","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Superb. ","This is superb. Slowing going missing in the market thus high price. One of the best single malt.  It is a vintage."
"95","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Interesting whisky","Nose: fruit, figs, almond, tropical fruitsTaste: subtle spice, Sweet, a tiny bite. Finish : medium & warmingAverage in my humble opinion since it's a very expensive comparatively "
"96","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Not bad at all","Was worth it when I bought it for $60 US but at over $100 its tough to say that its worth it.  But Yamazaki is through the roof so that's about right."
"97","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","I LOVED the distiller's reserve, this was a disappointment!","This is almost double the price than distiller's reserve and you just have a touch of the good tastes that the reserve got. You feel the alcohol way to much, it's not even close to it's little brother!"
"98","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Manoj Ramchandani  ","Fabulous single malt like music to your mind n soul smooth n delicious prefer it to the Yamazaki 18 years "
"99","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Excellent","This is a very tasty whisky and is very smooth.  It is easy to drink and its aroma is delicate and lovely.  For those who are interested in a nice whisky that anyone can drink try this one.  "
"100","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","The Seeker reviews Yamazaki 12 Year Old. ","An absolutely mouth watering nose of creamy nuttiness and fruit medley. This carries on wonderfully onto the palate with a clear Bourbon influence which is also obvious on the nose. A lingering fruit and oaky finish wraps things up perfectly. There's no smoke or peat just fruit and spice akin to the aforementioned Bourbons it so closely resembles. This is a textbook Japanese Single Malt. The only downside is the price which is way too steep at present. Luckily I had mine for just £35 from a good friend which is an absolute steal. "
"101","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very good","First off I'll say that I found this much cheaper than others on here so I went in to to it a lot more open minded and with lower expectations. This whisky is fantastic. The nose is very sweet, with strong vanilla coming through. It is a very light whisky, and really shines neat. The finish is strongly reminiscent of bourbon, reminding me of Blantons more than anything else. Overall if you can find this for a good price, it is definitely worth adding to your collection. "
"102","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Good but hype. Carzy price.","It was a good drink but I paid for fiddich 21, livet 18, macca 18, signet. get my point. hype and overrated is getting the price to increase. Crazy price. If can cut price by 30 % would have been 5 stars."
"103","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Manoj Ramchandani ","Super smooth absolutely relaxing with sweet taste just got a bottle from Barcelona airport am treasuring it as not in stock must buy n must try stunning "
"104","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Perfektion från Suntory.","Japaner lägger verkligen ned sin själ i vad de gör och det lönar sig. Häll upp ett glas och tillsätt 3 isbitar så vaknar whiskyn till och bjuder på en doftsensation som Skotsk whisky aldrig kan bjuda på. Skotsk whisky är ju helt död, oavsett vad du gör. "
"105","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Pretty good, but the hype for Japanese whisky is crazy","Quite enjoyed it, but like others have said for the price it's nothing special. Depressingly I found a bottle in my local alcohol shop in Portugal...€179 or roughly £140!!! I wonder when this hype over Japanese whisky will end?"
"106","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Love Bill Fucking Murry","This is training wheels for Scotch.   "
"107","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Excellent","Very smooth, well balanced, & tasty!"
"108","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","htpait@gmail.com","Dropped in one small ice cube, swirreled for several seconds and removed the ice cube. The smell of ripe bananas exploded and the finish reminded me of artichoke petals dipped in butter.Lovely!"
"109","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","mr s hopkins","a whiskey to savour a very good flavour profile"
"110","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Overrated and overpriced.","Acquired this after all hoopla exploded about Suntory's Yamazaki (mainly due to the Sherry cask version). I generally drink single-malt Scotch and straight Bourbon and, mainly because I am research before you buy person, I have generally had a wonderful journey through the world of whisky. I can honestly say, this was the first time I have felt let-down by a single malt. It's not that it's bad, it has an interesting and quite unique nose (which I think the MoM tasting notes are pretty on point about, though banana is the tropical fruit I think they are talking about) and the body is pretty full and substantial. That said, it isn't all that engaging and it feels muddled, with that banana stomping all over the short hints of sherry and citrus in the palate. That said, if you find the flavor profile interesting (and a lot of people do), then it would be easy to recommend at 40-50 dollars.Which brings us to price: even if I loved the profile, the execution is too muddled and fuzzy (almost blended-malt like) to be even remotely worth 80-100 dollars they are now charging for the 12. At 40 bucks it'd be reasonable, at 80+ it's just plain overpriced."
"111","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Delicious ","Me and my boyfriend have Been looking all over for this stuff..He loves this ...finally found a vendor I'm Miami.. So I'm driving down there from coconut creek tomorrow to get it. I will get him some for Christmas."
"112","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Smooth, rich, tasty mmmm..","The best whisky i've tried. My rank is 1 pl is yamazaki, 2nd glenlivet12, 3rd is chivas regal 12"
"113","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Beautiful","Just so smooth. Such a shame it's so hard to find these days."
"114","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very nice but......","tried a bottle I recently bought from m,Chester airport , I found it quite smooth and it seemed taste differently on each  taste  but I was disappointed when it had gone although I would be happy to buy @ 40-50 quid anything more  I think I would prefer a lagavullin 16 which  I thought was a touch smoother ."
"115","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Totally overrated","I have tried a lot of Japanese whiskies and this one is totally overrated i have to say. It is unfocused, to much taste of alcohol and you get the impression it is not 12 years old at all. There are some nice fruity and spicy notes but nothing comes together the way it should be in a 12 yo. If you wish to explore Japanese whisky go with Nikka taketsuru 17 or Hibiki 17. They are very different from this one but much better and much more well rounded. No point in spending so much money when you can get a good glenmorangie for half or 2/3s of the price. The 18yo is very interesting on the other hand, a bit pricy though."
"116","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Intensifed ","Looks like Scotch Whisky, smells like it, tastes like it, but...all characteristics have been elevated a notch.  I found it to be more intense in every category.  I really like it."
"117","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Awesome","This is the most enjoyable single malt I have ever had. Why can't I find it anywhere now???"
"118","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Unique and unlike American scotch or Irish ","Im a single malt scotch junkie through and through.  this whiskey is in a different category.  and I dig it.  the color is nice med light Amber and it leaves oily trails on the glass if you swirl it.  the nose is citrus through and through with notes of a sweeter fruit.  you'd almost expect it to be a sugary drink from the nose.  the mouthfeel is surprisingly dry which I like.  the finish is citrus.  and tart and bitter and I mean that as a compliment.  the flavor is subtle enough that if you enjoy it with different foods you might pick up different notes and flavors that you didn't notice before.  my final verdict though is biased.  as a stand alone whiskey I still prefer the unique taste of a peated scotch.  but I've had peated scotch I like less than this excellent whiskey.  cheers"
"119","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Yamazaki 12 year old. ","Had a sip in a bar and was hooked. expensive and difficult to find in the Philippines. found a dealer selling at equivalent of £65 and grabbed 2 bottles. I had the fortune of going to Jspan a few weeks later. Price  there was equivalent to £42. I grabbed another one, the last one. even in Japan, they are hard to come by. I am going back in October and will probably get 2 or 3 more. "
"120","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","best 12yr  out there ","Has a sweet flavor.  This whiskey is more complex than any 12yr you can find. Step it up Scotland, you are falling behind "
"121","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very good","tried this today on one bar. Very good End up buying for my friends as well.Nice smell and tasteLoved it "
"122","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Pretty Good","I am just enjoying a first sip of this and think it is pretty good. I would say that I enjoy an 18 Glenfiddich, or even The Glenlivet 12...even a Macallan for the price. Will definitely try more Japanese Whisky, but I wouldn't say I am going to get another bottle of this stuff again.It's good, but it leaves me wanting more after each sip."
"123","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Not bad","Tried this one a couple of years ago and just didn't ""get it"".  Nice whisky for sure, but tasted like a fairly standard/light Highland malt.  Nothing for peat-heads obviously, but very understated generally.  A good honest malt but not in a hurry to buy one even when it cost £35."
"124","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Scots can´t compete.","This is absolutely World class! It just couldent be better. Try it and enjoy Japanese perfection.If I were a Scot I´ll be worried...."

"126","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Fantastisk!","Köpte som prov, då jag ledsnat på de lite tråkiga skottska. Sedan dess köper jag endast Japanskt. Japanerna håller en grymt hög klass som på det mesta det gör. De som inte provat Japanskt har inte druckit Whiskey (citat från min 91 årige far)."

"130","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Tastes like Chocolate","We ate chocolate right before tasting this. So, we didn't get much citrus, we mostly got chocolate."
"131","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very nice","Smooth and well rounded.  Alcohol content is there but not over whelming.  First shot OTR,  but i am getting a little butterscotch on the back end.  I have spent 6 months with JW Platinum, this is parallel or a little finer.  Who would have thought ""Booze Traveler"" would accomplish anything?  Well it has.  Nice job to the show and especially the distillery."
"132","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Thumbs up","You guys weren't joking about the tropical notes... Bang on the money with that tasting note. "
"133","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing whisky even if you don't like Scotland Scotch.","first, I don't like the taste of Scotland scotch.   Yamazaki has a flavor all its own.  My daughter is in JET (Japanese assistant English teacher).  She bought me home a bottle for Christmas since all her Japanese friends love it.  Count me among them.  Totally unique flavor, in no way scotch like.  Fabulous taste, 2 shots = a nice buzz. She's definitely got to send me some more.  If you haven't tasted this you're in for a big surprise.  Who would have thought that anything besides good sake would come out of JApan ?"
"134","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Delectable","I've been wanting to try this for a while after tasting their Hibiki blend (which is delicious btw). Everywhere seems to be sold out or too expensive. I recently found three bottles in my local Tesco Metro for £40 a pop. I bought one, tried it, loved it and went straight back to buy the other two."
"135","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Spoiled brat","Lucky me, my brothers brother in law cracked open a Yamazaki he picked up in Tokyo on x'mas eve.  I was shocked after my first sip. There was no biting taste, very tasty and fruity with a long spicy finish.  I searched all over Chicago and the answer was the same, out of stock since before Thanksgiving thanks to all the publicity.  On a lark, I visited my neighborhood dram shop and they had it in stock.  More surprising was the actual price, 30-50% below internet price.  Needless to say I happily bought their entire stock and that of their sister store in the suburbs.  "
"136","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Try before You Die","there aren't words to describe this whisky. complex but smooth, classy yet down to earth, beautiful and tasty. all I could think of was this really cute girl next door that we grew up with. very pretty yet smart and well grounded. if you call yourself a single malt whisky drinker, then you better find a bottle yesterday. I can't say enough about this amazing dram. someone here said stock up, and I agree because prices on this whisky will only go up. the easiest 10 rating I have given. "
"137","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Suntory Unequaled","Living in Tokyo, I became a fan of Suntory Scotch for its smoothness and non-biting flavor. Yamazaki was not marketed then and I can only go by my favorite Suntory Reserve which was considered the distillery's premier brand. I did not realize Suntory whiskeys were available in the U.S. and bought an equally good substitute that comes closest to it : Chivas Regal. Since Suntory acquired Jim Beam, they are readily available and I bought a bottle last week.  An amazing whiskey. "
"138","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Whisky with class and Taste","I tried the Yamazaki 12 year old yesterday .The Blend is so wonderful and the taste savours in your mouth all the while.Very Light and simply beautiful for an enjoiable evening..Great Invention..."
"139","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Crazy mature","Totally agree with the reviewer saying it could pass for an 18.  I'm *currently* sipping it right next to an Aberlour 18 at double the price and it's almost identical (*slightly* more light-white-fruit and less heavy-red-fruit than the Aberlour in flavor profile, but only slightly; maturity feels identical).  I've got a Balvenie 12 nearby and it's significantly more rough and less flavorful, yet more expensive than the Yamazaki."
"140","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","To die for...","Stockpiling as I write..this is a wonderful whisky"
"141","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Wow....... 12 Years?","I'm a big fan of premium (Single Malt Scotch Whisky), this could definitely pass for an 18 year bottle of the good stuff..."
"142","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Yamazaki 12 year old ","I am not a whisky drinker,  and I bought the dram for my husband, but was then curious  and had a sip.  I actually liked it, and loved the fruity taste, the hint of almond and cinnamon. It had a nice ""Christmas"" flavour for my palate. "
"143","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","The best I have ever tasted","As the title says, this is a wonderful malt whisky. I was surprised and disappointed when my wife bought me a bottle, until that is I tasted it. If you like whisky, you are going to love this."
"144","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","price rise....?","A shame that it has risen by a tenner over the last couple of years... 25% increase.... really!?"
"145","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Great taste and flavour","Great tasting and balanced whiskey. Very smooth. Definitely one of my favorite single malts"
"146","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","ERII","I love it, hè is very soft, has his own taste and is one of THE greatest whisky's."
"147","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Flavorful","There's absolutely nothing bad I can say about this one except it's maybe *too* flavorful.  But even that...just marginally so.  It *slightly* tastes more aperitif than a whisky should IMO, but maybe that's the future.  The chocolate vaguely reminds me of the Bushmills 21 I once had, but more subtle.  Me, I'll still take something a bit more malty like a Glen Grant or Old Pulteney.  But this is still very good and worth a try."
"148","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Fantastic","Loved it. Simple as that. Only one small negative, a bottle of malt is enjoyed before it is opened, so please don't put a cheap arse plastic top on it! This bottle is way too good and should have a cork to get that pop from opening."
"149","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","I love it","but i'm in no position for professional tasting notes. But is there anyone but me that get alittle maple hint on the nose?"
"150","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","RRR","I can honestly say ""I have never tasted a better malt than this 12year old"".I've tasted a lot of whisky's in the last 40 years, some harsher, some not so harsh, Although not a connoisseur I know what I like,  and this is it... "

"153","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Needs a bit of time","I bought this bottle a long time ago for a party, freshly opened i found this to taste very odd, it had a strong sweetness and taste of caramel and about an equally strong bitter tannin taste and this yielded some sort of flat taste curve of sorts. It didn't linger and you was left with just this dry tannin taste.Now, however, it has been in the shelf for a few months at about 70% of content left and i tried this again last night and i must say i was very positively surprised, It have developed a very nice round sweet taste with some sort of vanilla mixed with some fruity jelly candy tastes and the nose felt very developed with first having very much orange peel -citrus smell where after the same jelly candy smell came about after a while.Definitely one of my favorites now!"
"154","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Rating for above","Solid drop."
"155","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Bit different but rather good.","Nice Change flora through the nose with some more exotic tones. Tastes rather good warmth again flora notes some honey sweetness and citrus,Maybe nicer for the Money but nice stuff and worth a try.Personally prefer the redbreast  to green spot and glenfarclaas to dalmorre but great thing whiskey something for everyone..."

"160","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","eye opener","This was the first whisky that opened my eyes to the wonderful world of single malts. Before this, I was in the obscure world of blends and the occasional Glenlivet and Glenfiddich 12. I've never looked back ever since. I've had the likes of many single malts throughout the years and The Yamazaki 12 is still on my top 3 favorites in the 12 year range.  "
"161","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","WM WHALIN","REAL GOOD NICK FLAVOR AND NOTES. LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT YOU DO NEXT. THANKS YOU"
"162","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","ok, but not great","Smooth it's ok, yamazaki 10 is much better and the 18 is the best I've ever had, would not buy a bottle of 12 again"

"167","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","One of the best","I was given a bottle of this for my birthday last week and I must say it it probably amongst the best malts I have EVER had the pleasure to enjoy.Get over your parochial prejudice and give it a try . . . you won't be disappointed."
"168","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Excellent but a bit sweet","Smooth is the word. And adding water,  is a must to bring out the smells and taste. I recommend about 30-40% which is a tad more than for most.The only objection is that it is a whisky intended for the broad audience and so the experience is a bit, well average. Then again my taste is for the somewhat more smokey and with a tad more oomph. It is a bit on the sweet side in my view. Then again you cannot go wrong serving Yamazaki to your guests after your finer dinner though."
"169","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Loved it","I picked up a bottle of this because it looked different.  Couldn't have been happier I did!  I will say (from my experience), adding a drop of water really adds to this.  It settles it down and allows the smells and taste to develop.  Try it and let me know!"
"170","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Really good","Smooth dram and very interesting experience from Japan.Arigato Gozaimashita!"
"171","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Mixed feelings","I had a lot of expectations from this whisky, my gf got me a bottle for Christmas,it turned out I was mostly disappointed. The nose is really great,and there are some interesting notes but I found the palate very unrefined and with poor balance. A rough aftertaste that I did not appreciate at all. Did not taste smooth at all imo. Anyway I'll try to give another shot at Yamazaki with the 18 yo."
"172","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Rather good","Lovely smooth 12 yr old. Excellent finish, but have I gone mad. Dentist like numbness to follow. "
"173","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Rubbish","I found this is taste rather unrefined and very disappointing.If you love a good single malt, this certainly isn't one.Go for Aberfeldy 12 which is both cheaper and better than this one."
"174","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Excellent or ""Subarashi"" as the Japanese might say.","The French and Italians didn't invent wine but became very famous for it, I suspect the same is happening with Japanese whisky.The Yamazaki 12yo is very smooth and robust with spicy dried fruit and creme brulee on the palate.Nikka whisky's Yoichi and Hibiki 12yo are very nice if you can find them."

"182","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","It tastes different now than last time","It tastes much differnt than with ice from the spar than from ice from my mums house.  other than that its a lovely rich flavour. "
"183","Yamazaki 12 Year Old","Yamazaki","Love this whiskey.","Phenomenal!  A great whiskey for the price.  I like it as much as the Yamazaki 18, but it is quite a bit cheaper.  Buy a bottle and you will know why the Japanese whiskeys are doing so well at international awards.  Just so I don't sound biased towards Japanese whiskeys, I am drinking a dram of Highland Park 18 right now and enjoying it thoroughly."
"184","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Bit disappointing for the price","Good not great"
"185","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","One of the best, but best brace for the hit to your wallet","This is one of the finest whiskys I've tasted, I generally keep several bottles of the 12 on hand but reserve the 18 for special occasions only. Mouthfeel is a rich and oily. The nose has hints of char, oak, fruit, caramel, vanilla and a spicy character one can likely attribute to the mizunara oak casks used during maturation. The palate continues in this fashion, but a nutty/malty character also emerges. The finish is sweet, with a notable fruity sherry influence, more malt, nuts, and hit of spicy oak. This is a rich whisky that can rightly be described as ""luxurious"". I've tried a number of single malts including many similarly aged Scotch single malts, and this ranks with the best. My only caveat would be the inflated price tag, which unfortunately seems to impact any age-statement Japanese whisky these days. That said, it's a cracking good dram and well worth trying if you run into it on the whiskey menu of an upscale bar."
"186","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Wish it was easier to find","Lucked out and got it from Master of Malt, but so hard to find. One of the best Japanese whisky’s you can get your hands on if you’re lucky."
"187","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","My favorite Japanese whisky","Big step up from the 12. One of my favorites!"
"188","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Save your money","Unimpressive, hot on the nose, and certainly not worth the price of admission. I have enjoyed a number of single malts with far more depth and character at a fraction of the cost. Moving on..."
"189","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Pieace of Art","A little bit better than 12, basic flavors are same but more round deep. A little bit smoother u will feel it. But i did not like only bitterness at the end it still in my mouth after 15 minutes, some may like small bitterness like from ipa beer. If i choose btw 12 and 18 its 18 definitely, its piece of Art.

"196","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Second Best Whisky I've EVER Tasted","Without a doubt the pinnacle of Japanese Whisky. Not the merest hint of Sulphur present and a nose and taste that takes me back to the finest of scotch I tasted in the 80's and 90's. Second only to The Macallan 30 Year Old Sherry Oak for Whisky Heaven."
"197","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very tasty","I remember when a bottle cost 100$ a few years ago before the mass started enjoying it.  Now its too expensive. Aint worth it "
"198","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Back from the Distillery","I've had Yamazaki 12 for years now. My wife and I just wrapped a 2 week vacation in Japan. While there I was lucky enough to stop in at the Suntory Yamazaki distillery. They let you sample Hibiki 21, Hakushu 18 and Yamazaki 18. Being on a budget I could only purchase one and I was going for the Hibiki 21. By far the best whiskey I have ever tasted. Unfortunately they were sold out. I hate to say that the Yamazaki 18 came in second but it's a good second. It has amazing flavors and is extremely smooth. The 700 ml bottle cost me 27,000 yen or around $240 US. Since I won't be going back to Japan any time soon this will only come out on special occasions."
"199","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Steff","Shengus, man, shengus. Pure shanner of a dram."
"200","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Best whisky around","Lucky enough to have bought a couple of bottles when priced around £160.00, Only bring them out on special occasions. Best comparison i have come across so far is the Aultmore 2015 19yr but that is still not cheap at £200.00 a bottle."
"201","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","found 3 but not easy","Ive been running after this since the first sip three years ago.  Price has gone from around $200 to now $400, if you can find it. Ive  had every 18 available and many 25's.  Yamazaki 18 best by far, not even close. Dangerous dram indeed!  Yamazaki 25 is just too expensive to try."
"202","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","nectar of the gods","By far the best whisky i have so far tried, and now my life becomes a search to find something as good that doesnt cost £400 a bottle as this now does. I have 2/3rds a bottle in my possession but scared to drink it as may never own another :( - if you've found anything as good please tell us what it is! A clear 10 out of ten, perfection in a glass for those lucky (or rich) enough to get their hands on it"

"207","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","AMAZING !!!!","Best whisky under $400 I've had.  I paid way too much for this. At $215 I still say its very worth it.  You cant buy this stuff for $215 anywhere though.  Its got a hugh great Almond Vanilla and Caramel nose and Marshmellow and citrus peel mid-palate and solid finish.  I will buy a second bottle as soon as its available. "

A few days later I went back and tried it again, and then again...and a splash of water really helped. Nose - Japanese plum, apricot and bananaPalate - like a cricket bat of oak right between the eyes and then a rush of fruitFinish - very long, more plum and apricot. Really very very good.  "

"225","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","You think so?","I would love to agree with the comments here but on the 18 year I just cannot!I had a double shot in an underground retro bar on the Midosuji side of Osaka station with perfect female company and ( maybe I stuck my nose in too far) was assaulted by the alcohol, making me regret my double for the price of a single purchase. The 18 year old grew on me but guess what?For half the price and a sublime experience get hold of the Nikka 21 year old-it is a gem!I'm not  anti Suntory- far from it, the 25 year old Yamazaki is in my whisky dreams but the 18 year old....sorry, it doesn't move me enough."
"226","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Love, don't like","I wrote the conversely-titled review earlier.  I've changed my tune.  My tasting notes are still essentially the same, but I've grown to appreciate them more.  Just because it's so distinct.I'd think almost anyone would have go through this in stages like I did.  At first it's just, eh, interesting, but is it *really* what I want?  (And for *that* kind of money?)  However after working my way through the whiskey world, there's just something about this that keeps drawing me back.  It's like nothing else that I've ever tasted.  Each nose, each sip, each swallow, is its own experience.Note the 12 is still excellent too, but in a completely different way."
"227","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing taste ","this whiskey is the best 18yr  ive tasted. but for the price old Pulteney 21 is better because it cost less with a better finish"
"228","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Overrated","you can do better for less money"
"229","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Zoom On A Yamaza","Rev up your engine and enjoy to the fullest for this bottle will take your taste-buds on a ride that you don't want to stop. Really makes me enjoy Japanese whisky and how intrinsic they are to the whisky community. Malty, sultana, white grapes, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, brown sugar with a sherry oak flavor. Goes down smooth, no smoke and full of body. A+. Look forward to buying another bottle. "
"230","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Like, don't love","Was REALLY excited to get this as an Xmas gift. Love the Yamazaki 12, and given all the reviews/awards on this one I thought it must be ""the one"". Especially given how hard it is to find in the US, this was the best present I could have asked for.It's hard to say that this isn't good or even that it isn't phenomenal. It's perfect if it's what you want. It's old though. Some old book, old pipe resin there. Just enough, and perfectly done, to be a perfect malt if you like that kind of feel. Not so much that it overwhelms the other rich influences (like Bushmills does); just enough to say I'm *aged* and if you don't like it then that's *your* problem.So, that's that. For my money, I like a Mac 18 with its sherry feel or even a Auchentoshan 21 with its terrific vanilla smoothness but slight punch, a little more. Still, tasting side-by-side with the 12, I can get that they're related but this is way better; and I like the 12 a lot...so I'll probably keep one of these around, if I can keep finding it; maybe it's one of those things that needs to grow on you.  (My first taste was 3 weeks ago)."
"231","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Best Whiskey. Period.","I have had the opportunity to try many whiskeys across the world, including johnny walkers of all colors (including blue), but Yamasaki 18 is the smoothest, most perfectly balanced whiskey I have ever come across. Some people prefer more peaty finishes, more spice, more...something, but the Yamasaki is a literal distillation of Japanese Kaizen (refinement until perfection). Buy a bottle and keep it on the shelf to celebrate sublime moments in life. I just bought a new bottle to celebrate the birth of my son, and look forward to opening it in another 18 years."
"232","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Awesome but think twice at $230","This is a great whisky and maybe I'm being to harsh saying that $230 is too much.  The way its made, the sherry casks, with slight pete smoke, and the clean pure flavor that it produces are A+.  That being said, I'd rather own a Macallan Ruby or a Macallan 18 for the price.  If you're anything like I am and read these reviews, I'll tell you that I will always buy another Mac 12,18 Ruby, or Mac 25.  I can't really live without them.  I find myself reaching for this range of scotches 9 times out of 10 over the Yamazaki.  All that said, this is a great dram, and I'll guarantee you'll like it.  I'll even rate it 5 stars.  However with all that said, if I were running from a burning building and I could only take one bottle of whisky in my collection, I'd leave this one behind and grab the Mac 18 instead."
"233","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing!!!","If anyone have only been drinking Single Malt Whisky from Scotland, give this a try soon. Chances are that you will be stuck and love this for a LONG time.The way this whisky was made is so clean and can be drunk so effortless with a sweet scent that captivates you to just want to on drink it. The next time you would have realized that the whole bottle is finished. Yes, it is that smooth and I will leave the tasting notes to each individual to experience it. "
"234","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Lovely Whisky, great service by Master of Malt","First time buying whisky online, and very happy with the fast service at good value from this website.Yamazaki 18 is a super single malt. A favourite."
"235","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Big whisky, but big bucks (Fat Pig Whisky Club)","On the nose this has lots of burnt lemon like its been charred on a BBQ with some sweet sherry raisin and a touch of pepper.On the palette is more burnt citrus fruit, but more like orange this time with some complex molasses and spice flavours on the finish. Some aniseed, cinnamon and nutmeg lingers on the finish.An absolute belter of a whisky. Worth the punt if you can split the cost and share a bottle between some good friends."
"236","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Best of the Bunch","I recently tried eight Japanese whiskeys (for the first time) and narrowed it down to this one and the 21-year blended Hibiki. Same price, but I went with the Yamazaki will get the Hibiki next time. Both are among the best whiskeys I've EVER tried. And this is coming from a bourbon drinker."
"237","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Speechless","Recently came back trip from Japan. Tried the Yamazaki 12YO, 18YO and 25 YO at the Suntory Factory just outside of Osaka. Very distinct flavour and differences. 12YO is nice, but for the best value, smoothness and taste, 18YO on the rocks is my pick. Compared 18Y Yamazaki to 18YO McCallum, Yamazaki 18Y because of the smoothness and pleasant taste.25YO for those with an acquired taste after a more intense oak/smoke favour.My only regret is not bringing a few bottles back from japan. Australia doesn't sell/have 18YO Yamazaki readily available here. Hope this helps!"
"238","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing","This is the first Japanese single malt I experienced, and it is quite smooth and pleasant in taste."
"239","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Looking forward to it!","Just returned from a motorcycle trip around Japan (Honshu, Kyushu and Shokuku).  We needed to burn some spare Yen at Haneda Airport, so I bought a bottle of the Yamazaki 18 year at Duty Free.  Can't wait to try it."
"240","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Seinaru ushi!","I tried this for the first time over the weekend (1/25) and all I can say is Holy Cow!  I've heard about the Japanese whiskies, but never had a chance to sample one.  The flavors of vanilla, smoke, chocolate, sherry, oak and honey.  I passed my glass to my friend and she refused to give my glass back...and she doesn't drink whisky!  I'm buying a bottle as soon as I can get my hands on one."
"241","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Best all around","Absolutely phenom!!!  Big oak, nice finish!"
"242","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Classy dram","Color:  Dark AmberNose: Rich in oak.  I pick up both the sherry casks and herbal notes from the Japanese oak.Palate:  Very rich and complex.  Notes of chocolate, licorice and fruit.Finish:  Quite long."
"243","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Best I've tasted (tie)","This and the Aussie 'Limeburner' would be the best whiskies I've tasted."
"244","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","i wish i had the money ","only ever had the chance to have one bottle of this brill dram because of the price. best ive ever had"
"245","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Yamazaki 18yo","a taste of heaven. Tones of raisins and vanilla. very rich flavour"
"246","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","the best yet!, but keeping my mind open","so smooth and complex, brilliant"
"247","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Superb Whiskey","This has to be my favourite. Absolutely fun to the nose, and pleasant on the taste as well. Would definitely recommend this."
"248","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","What's","goin on"
"249","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","A Knockout","I'm new to Japanese whiskies but this was fantastic, easily my current favorite. My first bottle is almost done and there are 2 on standby. So good it's the type of dram you want a case of just in case they stop making it. Full of flavor, complexity and will probably please most serious Scotch drinkers."
"250","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","mmmmmmmmmmm","I only had a dram of this remarkable whiskey, but simply put it is unique,the nose on this will make you feel very excitedthe japanese have nailed this craftthe obsession with their whiskey has begun"
"251","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Great whisky!","Smooth, decadent and intense. With everyting you can hpe for in an 18 yo single malt. This is one of the best whiskies I have tried!"
"252","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","To add to the above review from Same person..","Both the Yamazaki 18 Year Old and the Bufallo Trace they both have notes of rum which is just great"
"253","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","OMG!! Yamazaki 18 Year Old Vs Bufallo Trace (old bottle)","Im no whisky expert and bought the Yamazaki 18 as a punt due to its great reviews and the fact i had never tasted a JP whisky before.After tasting it i came to the conclusion that it was a very good whisky.First impressions were a rich floral sherry bouquet ,sweet, woody smooth/balanced/very rounded.After finishing it though i would probs not buy again due to its high price point.Well i have just bought a bottle of Buffalo Trace(old bottling) and after opening the bottle and pouring a glass and noticed instantly that this is similar to the bouquet of the Yamazaki 18 with its floral,honey,sherry aroma.Taste wise its very similar but with more burn and spice which probably is due to its higher ABV at 45% and spices added.This bourbon is just great and believe me if you liked the Yamazaki 18 its a no brainer.The Yamazaki 18 is smoother and more complex in all areas but for the price the Buffalo trace is a clear winner at 55 pounds for 1.75 L."
"254","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","no words","This is by far the best whisky I have tasted for a long time, I feel bad saying this as I am Scottish, but you know what - they have got it right. As soon as you smell this whisky, you say to yourself oh boy this gonna be good.Going to buy a full bottle next month for sure."
"255","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Lovely, easy drinking","Great sherried (but not overly) smooth and easy drinking whisky. Getting on the pricey side these days - but price aside,it's delicious. Only problem is its moreishness and easy drinking can lead to slightly overdoing it... "
"256","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Not peated","I disagree with the below comment, the Yamazaki 18 year old is not heavily peated. A lovely dram though, with lots going on!"
"257","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","MultiWandering","The Whisky is extremely peated, not my taste, but very smooth, I can see why others like it, it has a very long finish and is otherwise very nice, but very peated."
"258","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Great dram","Much darker and oakier than the 10 and 12 year old Yamazakis, but not at all bitter (unlike some other old dark whiskies I've tried)"
"259","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","My New Favorite","Simply put, a fabulous whiskey. Well worth the price."
"260","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Fantasticles","One of my fave whiskeys.It is intensely sherry but also incredibly complex and shifting between sips.Sometimes i can get an incredible aged parchment dry finish, other times it seems like im drinking liquid christmas pudding.All in all a positively schizophrenic whiskey but absolutely blinding."
"261","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Interesting","Quite different to the Scottish drams I've been getting used to but doesn't suffer for that. Lots of depth to the flavours, they come at you in very distinct waves...very tricky to describe but not encountered anything quite like it in the Islay/Speyside single malts I've tried so far and would happily recommend this to anyone"
"262","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Great Whiskey","Managed to pick up a bottle from Birmingham Airport Duty Free for £32. Fantastic find and easily worth double the price.Incredibly balanced flavour.    "
"263","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","My favorite!","What?!  No 5 star reviews?  Very much time for one.  This is my favorite whiskey.  Not only a paragon of Japanese whiskey, but a paragon of whiskey period.  I wish it were cheaper, but such is life.  I have tried and enjoy many whiskeys, but this is definitely my number 1."

"267","Yamazaki 18 Year Old","Yamazaki","Jögge","Awesome!"
"268","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Liquid Gold","Totally fantastic whiskey, favourite."
"269","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Amazing Whiskey","I've been to the Yamazaki distillery in Japan, and have tried all of them except for the 25 year.   For every day sipping whiskey, I prefer the 10 to the 12 year.  Unlike other whiskey's there's a real difference between them. The 10 is a little smoother, while the 12 year is more complex. It's interesting, because the regular single malt bottle has a deep charred taste from the barrel, that mellows out over time.  At 10 years, it's mellowed out as much as it's going to. By 12, it's gained complexity.   At 18 years, it's like nothing else.  It seems to change flavor in your mouth for about a minute.  Unreal. So, if you can get it the 10 year is a great in-between whiskey. "
"270","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Very, very good.","You simply dont get annything better single malts for this price! "
"271","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Nice Whisky ","This is a very good 10 year old whisky it has a nice round body of flavours and stands up to top brands.  "
"272","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","simply great","First try of Japanese Whisky and it is very promising. 18 yo is the next goal. I highly recommend this as alternative to Scottish standard"
"273","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Nice & smooth..","Nice one"
"274","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Exquisite","Great dram. Buy this before it runs out! Soon to be discontinued! But the 12 year old is even better though... or the 18!"
"275","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Just bought a bottle First ever bottle of Japanese I've ever bought, looking forward to it","Got a little bit of spice to it, it's smooth too. Would I buy another bottle? Yes. Next purchase Yamazaki 18yrs as it's won awards"
"276","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Just bought a bottle","First ever bottle of Japanese I've ever bought, looking forward to it"
"277","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Peoples tastes differs, but can only recommend it.","Favourite of mine. Rich honey sweetness with clear malt taste. The word ""smooth"" is enough to describe."
"278","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Debate","This is simply put, absolutely beautiful.My very first purchase of a japanese whiskeyThe flavours arrive in waves, i thoroughly recommend this i have tried the 12 year old, and 18, and boy do they hit the spotThe japanese have nailed the craft of exquisite whiskey'sStephen McGiff, st.ives cornwall....."
"279","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Expensive mixer","Can only drink this with a mixer, you're better off with an super market own brand."
"280","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Waste of Money!","Why do you stock this stuff? The 12 is just as bad! Anything is better than this!"
"281","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Prefer metho","horrible"
"282","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Beautiful unique Whisky ","You know nothing of what you speak. It's your taste that is awful. "
"283","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Awful!","Tried this a while ago - foul just about describes it.Thankfully the supermarket where purchased, exchanged it for something worthy of the price charged.To date, it's the only single malt I've been so horrified with. Others have been at least drinkable, even if they were too peaty or too spirited for my palette."
"284","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","Not bad, not great","I found the body lacking in depth, but well-rounded and subtle. Excellent finish yet short-lived. Definitely not a bad choice, but in this price range I'd say with this one you're paying a bit extra for the exotic aspect of the deal. "
"285","Yamazaki 10 Year Old","Yamazaki","The best 10YO","Absolute quality! Very complex nose, including plummy bananas or banana plums.Big&round in the palate, with a lingering fruity/automnal finish. I'd say this is the best whisky in the 10YO range."
"286","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","My God. ","There's not much to say. I've never tasted a whisky like this. To be honest, at first I was skeptical. The nose was familiar, the mouthfeel familiar. The taste familiar. But the finish. Oh. My. God. Not one single whisky I've experienced is even remotely Close to the complexity and longevity of the finish found in this gem. Raisin, chocolate, almond, all working their way from deep at the back of your tongue, and slowly to the front, with a never ending evolution of experience. I count at least 1-2 minutes of altering experiences!I've sadly never owned a bottle, and only experienced it as a single nip. But that nip was heavenly. "
"287","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Very much like Macallan 18","I got a 3cl sample of this and just tried it.  This is so much like Magellan 18 I couldn't believe it!  The Yamazaki 18 is also sherried, but lighter sherry and slightly sweet compared to the Yamazaki Sherry Cask.  The Macallan 18, in comparison, has a deeper sherry flavor, likely due to the fact that it is a true Speyside character to balance.  The Sherry cask has a slightly more complex sherry nuance compared to Macallan 18, but they are so much alike it may be challenging to decipher the two in a blind taste test.I'm glad I had a chance to try it, as the novelty of being best whiskey that year in Murray's whiskey bible.  It is the best example of a sherried whiskey........somewhere between Macallan 18 and Ardbeg Dark Cove (a more heavily sherried islay), more closer to the former than the latter."

Because the suntory don't produce 50000 bottle at a reasonable price instead that only few bottle at shameful price? Even if I had all the money of the world, I do not buy it for 3500€."
"291","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","It's very rare & priced accordingly ","Was recently very fortunate to try a dram of this and there's no doubt it's a cohesive, well balanced, flavorsome expression, packed with depth and complexity...but... stand it up against a Gordon & MacPhail 25 - 30 year old sherry cask Strathisla at less than a sixth of the price and in my humble opinion there can only be one winner, and not only on cost either.Loving your work M of M guys, keep it up.Dave"

"331","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Really good whisky but not amazing","This whisky is very good but not amazing, scores 88 points in my opinion.  Not really worth the price of £200 as you can get some sherried beauties that score 90-95 for this price or less.  As for the second market price - don't even go there.  To the below...........I have tasted this whisky and there are many substitutes, I don't even have time to list them all right now so no need for the love-in with Suntory.  "
"332","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Conclusion","there is a reason why this whisky is in high demand, it's not because it's highly rated in some review, it's because if you have tasted this whisky, you will realize that there are absolutely no substitutes. Even if there were, none of you will be posting all these negative remarks and showing how ugly you truly are.Yes, it's uncool for Suntory to make small batches every year, but have you thought that maybe that reason is because they are perfectionist? They won't release mediocre whisky into the market just to make money, especially since their cost price to people like MoM is as per the norm. All I'm saying is, if there's a high demand for a product, be prepared to pay for it, if you can't afford it, go drink something else. If there's a substitute for it, go buy that instead and stop complaining that this is just another overrated whisky. I've tried it and it's the best whisky I've ever tasted. Even if you think I'm wrong, taste is all personal, not general.  Thank you MoM for giving us a chance to own this bottle at a fair price. "
"333","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Response to shame on you alone ","I have plenty of respect for whisky 'drinkers' (although £200 for a NAS is frankly ridiculous). My post called foul on the 'investors', I thought that much was clear? This is the whisky equivalent of all those empty London flats, nothing but safety deposit boxes for the super rich. I have no problem calling this out for what it is. If you get a bottle and drink it, fair play. But whisky should be drunk. I've met Shinji personally and I wonder if it would sadden him that much of this expression, which I'm certain he has invested time and care in, will never be drunk. Investors are a reality of the secondary market but this frenzy is an affront. Sic transit gloria mundi! "

If you are old enough to drink Sir then you are old enough to act with some degree of maturity and integrity and respect for fellow whisky drinkers,collectors,investors or whatever it's  quite simply we all have choices In life ,if this is so upsetting to you that you feel the need for such vulgarity of spitting in someone's face ( it's one thing to think such nasty thoughts it's another level to write it )then start drinking something else - may I suggest coke ( tons of it everywhere!) then you will never have the need to whinge,whine,insult and behave like a spoilt brat."

Yup, this is what it's come to.  I spit in all your shameless faces.The retailers should start selling their wares in unsealed screw cap bottles to ensure the contents are simply drunk.

Some people saying that if a retailer auctions them then "" The customer pays market price for the whisky"".  Okay, lets assume we should pay ""market price"" ie auction price from an online retailer.  That would be on the assumption that everything is  worth was somebody is willing to pay for them.  I have an idea that would make this suggestion fair across the board...How about the stuff on here that is OVERPRICED, as in over market value, you start auctioning at £0 with no reserve.  Customers can bid what they like and anything that is sold below the recommended retail price, MoM can kindly donate the money to charity.  I'm thinking things like Octomore which is on here for over £100 but was way overpriced and can be bought for £50 to £6o at auction.  Sound fair?  Good cause etc etc? No didn't think so...  Just get on with the lottery please! "
"355","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Lottery","I agree with one of the comments below, break the seal and let the genuine drinkers acquire a bottle."
"356","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","whiners","Are people on this forum aware that Suntory opened a lottery application window for this release for only 2 weeks in January in Japan. Any direct buyers had to apply during those to weeks to be eligible  for the lottery. Why is everyone giving MoM a hard time about a lottery system. Be happy that you can still join the lottery because the window has passed here in Japan."
"357","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","@Allocation?","Tell that to the distillery in Japan that try to inflate their whisky prices globally by using those marketing tactics.@The the comment below!Agreed. Let me add the fact that, If I am not mistaken, when have we ever seen before a whisky go on global sale in the form of lottery? That's most probably a first and from the looks of it, is not going to be the last time. It seems like the Japanese haven't only mastered the art of Karate but other forms of art. Marketing shenanigans 101.Let's also ignore the fact that a whisky product will be sold in the form of an auction on non-auction house whisky website/store.Controversy in the comments section of MoM is not a first either and I am sure they enjoy that each and every time if not nudge it a bit."
"358","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Gambling at auction ","When your customers buy a bottle of whisky from you, it's up to them what they do with it. People have lost hundreds of pounds by putting there bottles into auction and when one bottle comes along which is a sure winner and came make their money back we can't even buy that in the normal way that were used to.

"359","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","The down turn","What's the matter master of malt? Aren't the rest of your products selling? So you've seen away how one product can cover your costs for the whole year. "
"360","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Free market economy","Auctions have their place. I wouldn't even begrudge a speculator grabbing a bottle and flipping it to make a few quid. Free market economy allows us that freedom so we shouldn't bemoan it. Hey, eBay works ok right?That said, an online retailer auctioning product doesn't feel right to me. The charity thing is a red herring and yes, possibly a cyclical publicity stunt to raise profile of business. ALL bottles should be placed in a lottery for registered customers. Those customers pay RRP. Any of those customers want to flip the bottle? Fair play. Their prerogative. "
"361","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","The the comment below! ","You forgot to mention the self righteous category that you obviously fall under!  It seems there are some that feel they are in some way above all of this crazy hype over a drink that we clearly wouldn't even know about unless we heard of it through the Whisky Bible.  Of course people are bitter!  The process of getting this probably fantastic product fairly to the market place has been an absolute shambles.  I fail to see how people voicing their concerns automatically places them in one of the three categories below.  Having said that, this is coming from someone who has the time to check in on internet comments on a daily basis for his own personal amusement.  I suggest finding a new hobby to avoid your even sadder existence that awaits you once this listing is over!   "
"362","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Allocation?","Question to all of you who thinks the bottles only should be sold to UK residents.I understand that you want to keep the bottles to yourself and thereby getting some kind off better oddsof getting one.But what do you think about the countries that dont get any allocation at all? Should they be left outside? The last thing I read was that my country would not have any.I can guarantee that there is 3500 people in Japan (1500 bottles of 5000 to Japan) that thinks that ""their"" Whisky should not be sold outside of Japan."

"364","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","For the drinkers!!!!","I think some people might be more annoyed at the returns they wont make more like.  It's already at over £1K on an auction site which doesn't end until the weekend and most of these will just appear on these types of sites within a month. How about MOM break the seal for each bottle and then lottery it off.  This will sort the genuine drinkers from the money makers.Either way - JUST GET ON WITH IT! "
"365","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","This is meant to be fun!","I don't have any issue with either the auction or the raffle. Admittedly I'm not rich enough to win the auction but as for the lottery I'd rather be in with a chance of winning a bottle than having no chance which is where I am currently! It's a tough situation for the retailers as there simply isn't enough to go round but that's true for lots of bottles so I don't see why there is such outrage when there is actually a chance some of the people complaining may actually win a bottle!If I don't win sure I'll be jealous but I'll take the £200 and buy another bottle.I think we should remember that this whole pastime is meant to be fun! And who doesn't get excited at a lottery!"

I wouldn't attempt to purchase a bottle from a German/Dutch/French website. If bottles are allocated to a country, they should stay there. Also, auctions are contemptible. "
"370","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","@ @""Japanese Whisky""","The issue is not charity and donating in general.The issue is (a) by saying proceeds (above RRP) go to charity it automatically implies there's gonna be a bidding war. The price will go way up there where ordinary folks like you and I won't even stand a chance to buy and (b) I think you got it wrong. You say ""MoM give the excess to charity so they're not accused of profiteering.""Way up there in the page is says - ""(where anything over RRP will be donated to charity)""Where do you think this ""over RRP"" comes from?Where do you see MoM saying they'll put money from their pocket?It's their customers' pocket...Like many people mentioned below. Everyone chooses to donate to the charity of their choice.As for UK addresses I can only assume the comments that oppose to this are from outside the UK? Surely.MoM is UK based and their profits for the most part come from UK customers. Not from international sales.This coupled with the fact that there is only a handful of bottles allocated within the UK (most of which are already reserved for rich clientele and high end bars) I don't see what's unfair about it.If the US gets its allocation of bottles why should a folk from the states have a chance to buy from the UK site? Any UK site for that matter."
"371","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Good work","This is the only honest way of getting to taste this.  What other ways do retailers have of getting this to us drinkers.  If you don’t like it, you have very little choice.Either ignore the hype and sit it out.Wait to see if a bottle arrives on an auction site and put the hammer price in the pocket of the auction site or that of someone looking to make a quick profit.There are plenty of other £200 bottles that may be better.The hype around this is only based on the 2013 bottle and the unusual hype and increasing price of Japan Whisky anyway.I for one want to taste it, purely because I want to see the difference between the bottles I can afford/buy and those that are supposed to the best in the world.  I cant afford a bottle but ill certainly be on the look out for a 3cl sample.Good luck to everyone."

When will you people learn the difference???  Or perhaps you don't fully understand what they are proposing?  An auction is when people all bid for something.  If the auction price starts at £200, then guess what?  People will have to pay more!!! And lastly THIS IS NOT AN AUCTION SITE!!!  Its a respected online retailer that has been entrusted by multiple brands to adhere to the RETAIL price.  Do you understand yet..."
"373","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","@""Japanese Whisky""","""As for the auction this is a joke.@MoM if you want to donate to charity do it from your own pocket. Don't force it upon your customers.""They're not forcing anybody to donate to charity. The customer pays market price for the whisky. MoM give the excess to charity so they're not accused of profiteering. If you don't like it, go and buy your bottle off another online auction so that you're donating to a private individual instead - that's obviously preferable, right?"
"374","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","True Retail Price Matters","To the Gordan Gekko wannaby below.  The Market rate is £200, this is not an auction site!  And Yamazaki do care about this kind of thing!  Any respected retailer has an obligation to adhere to the set retail price.  Retailers that don't stand to risk not getting future allocation.  THAT is the real world. Thats also why in Japan 100% that was retailed was by way of auction!  Nice try at sounding clever though ! "
"375","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","You're not Gordan Gekko ","Eh, the price Yamazaki set does matter!  That's why the set it and trust respected retailers to adhere to them.  That's why 100% of retail sales in Japan were by way of lottery.  Failure to stick to them usually results in future allocation being suspended.  THAT is how the real world works.  Not you're Gordan Gekko fantasy.  But nice try! "
"376","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","You're not Gordan Gekko! ","To the comments below asking us to stop whining:  ""Money talks"" are you serious?  Who do you think you are Gordan Gekko?  The retail price that Yamazaki set does matter.  It's the true market rate and respected retailers are DUTY bound to adhere to them.  Any that don't should have future allocation blocked.  THAT is how the real world works!  And as for good causes etc Give me a break.  I walked 970 miles in 35 degree heat last year for charity.  Three years before that I did the West Highland Way.  I also pay online to WWF.  I don't need dictated too by anyone else about giving to some unspecified charity when making an online purchase! The lottery system is fair (that's how 100% was allocated by retailers in Japan) the rest is a farce!  Glad MoM are half seeing sense.  Hope the rest get their knuckles rapped by Yamazaki for the utter shambles that has unfolded these last few weeks... "
"377","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Why Complain ","I'm out, so one less to  concern for the lottery/auction . To those who care, scotch come from Scotland, and there is a great variety,  for a great price. If you complaint so bad,  is over price, etc., don’t buy it. UK customers Only, RELLY, you must be a JOKE, can be take your comment for real. Master of Malt sales to the word, NOT JUST TO UK. One more thing, you complainers want to buy that bottle so bad..."
"378","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","All the comments below are hilarious. ","Seriously most of you sound like spoiled children. Splitting allocation between a charity (supporting worthwhile causes) and a lottery is fair and equitable. You guys clearly haven't seen how many other retailers have just instantly started selling their stock for double, triple, even 10x the recommended retail price. Well done to MoM for their model. (Just wish they'd hurry up with it! Surely they have the stock now.)Also for those saying this should be UK only - haha. MoM are a well-respected International retailer and would lose a lot of credibility doing so."
"379","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Stop whining","Life's not fair. Get over yourselves everyone.So much whining and whingeing, some people on here sound like complete BABIES.  Mummy, I didn't get what I wanted today. Waaaahhhhhhh!!Listen to yourselves.  All this rubbish about rich people getting priority.  That's LIFE.  Money talks guys, if you want this bottle you gonna pay the market rate which has absolutely nothing to do with whatever release price Yamazaki have decieded on."

"381","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Japanese Whisky","The problem is with Japanese Whisky in general. Prices have skyrocketed  in recent years.As good as Japanese Whisky might be it is certainly not worth £200 a bottle let alone $2500.This is purely marketing shenanigans to create artificial demand.Of course all retailers outside Japan are willing to indulge...and jump on the bandwagon.I hope buyers will wake up and sabotage any brand or retailer that manipulates prices like that.Having said that, the sale here should be restricted to UK residents only.As for the auction this is a joke.@MoM if you want to donate to charity do it from your own pocket. Don't force it upon your customers."
"382","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","UK Buyers Only","After the BTAC fiasco last year, there's no perfect way of allocating these highly sought after bottles, and while it pains me to see UK retailers following the American lottery system, I think this is the best way to allocate bottles, and I commend MoM for taking this step. Having said that, I agree entirely with the comment below - please MoM, if at all possible under EU trade laws restrict the lottery to UK buyers only. There is a huge amount of global demand for this whisky and as one of the most acclaimed online retailers in the world, there will be a huge interest for places in the lottery from all corners of the globe. If I had to guess, I think there will be less than 10 bottles available to the general public to buy in the UK once VIP customers, bars and hotels have received their priority allocation, and if this is the case, I think wherever possible, UK retailers should try to ensure British customers are given priority over international customers."
"383","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Hope this will be restricted to UK buyers","As their are only 198 bottles expected to come into the UK and 2 of the main suppliers have already allocated all of their stock to their VIP customers.  I can't see there being more than 50 bottles left for your average drinker, with some being auctioned off to people with the deepest pockets there will only be a handful of regular people who manage to get one.

To whom will be drawn you will give the opportunity to buy the bottle at its real price ($ 300).

"400","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Lotto and Auction ","I've been refreshing this site several time an hour for the last few days and on a few of those occasions I saw the price MoM is going to sell this bottle for. I called them directly thinking maybe there was a glitch on my side and the bottle had been put up for sale yet I could only see the ""coming soon!"" While I don't agree 100% on the auction, I'm ok with it because at least MoM isn't jacking up the price like one retailer I found in Japan who at least as of 3 days ago had a few bottles in stock and was selling each bottle for $3,600! I even emailed them to confirm the price. Their response was, ""yes we are selling it for $3,600 American dollars. This is our Marketing cost and know people way pay it for such a rare and highly sought out bottle"" that online Co is dekanta"
"401","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Cant agree more","Lottery yes, first come first serve yes, but auction is just playing into the whole marketing hype and inflating the price for no reason.

I beg you to make the right choice here."

"403","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","I call bullshit on a retailer auctioning stock.","It's bad enough that thanks to the ramblings of a certain panama-hatted, self-proclaimed whisky expert, we're forced to enter a sodding lottery to buy a bottle of whisky, but to put some up for auction is frankly embarrassing. I can only echo the sentiments of other commenters who made the valid point that such an auction is only for those with more money than sense, and it shouldn't be down to an online retailer to decide if we wish to give to charity; it smacks of a publicity stunt. I give to charity on my own terms, and not when I'm making a normal online purchase. "
"404","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","How lottery will work","Agree with others here.. Just stick to it being a lottery. You're only allowing person with most money to buy the bottle otherwise..As someone else suggested, charge a nominal £1 to enter.. Also, consider restricting to existing customers and not newly opened accounts.. That way, it stops multiple entries, and goes to existing, loyal M0M customers. You could just create a stock item that's ""1 per customer"", that once purchased if your entry.."

I managed to get 2 in Australia, but we only got 4 in my state.","Should lotto all of them off so everyone has an equal chance or people that want to enter the lottery pay £1 entry for the chance and that money goes to the charities that means people who's pockets aren't as deep have the same chance."
"406","Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2016","Yamazaki","Not Just for the Rich","I agree, the lottery system is very fair considering the limited amount of bottles produced, and the number of people that want them.

Bought it in July and waiting until December to try it. I'm a Kiwi, with all my ancestry tracing from Dundee, so I like my Scotch. Talisker has always been a favourite of mine, and this 25 in my books compares in quality to the Talisker 10. Thats sounding a bit disappointed for a $1000 bottle of scotch. Obviously it tastes nothing like the Talisker, its very heavy, you can taste the wood all through it, so much so its gotten a bit of a treacley twang, and lost the sharpness of how you'd expect the woody finish to be. For such an expensive whiskey, I was maybe expecting a bit more. Or maybe a bit less - of a battering ram of a powerful brew."

It won best single malt in the world in 2012 (http://www.whiskymag.com/awards/wwa/2012/), and FYI the Karuizawa 40yo is more than 10X the price of this! You got your decimal in the wrong place. Also, keep in mind that Yamazaki was not making as much whisky 25 years ago, and even less of that was Sherry matured. You're paying not just for age, but quality and rarity. Just save up more, as the previous reviewer said."

"458","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Our favorite","Our go to. Even better with a orange rind and soda water."
"459","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Harmonious, Interesting, Wan","Well-blended and interesting enough mixture of the Yamazaki and Hakushu flavour profiles (apricots, grass, something floral), but overly light and too marred by the grain. A higher abv and pure malt might go some way to correcting its failings. Not really worth getting over the rather superb individual malts, in fact a non-starter with the recent price inflation."
"460","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Not good","No, it did not work for me. My mistake, as I prefer single malt, but I let myself be convinced by the guy a the duty free counter, and bought this as I wanted to try something from the Japanese market. I am sorry but nothing special. Lovely bottle, though, which I will keep. As I am re-reading the marketing blurb at the back of the box I can translate it in two ways: let's just mix everything together and sell it for a fortune, OR let sit down and produce something harmonious and lovely. Lovely indeed, but nothing special."
"461","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Powerful and harmonious in the mouth. ","With a Golden Color and sparkling bright, the Hibiki is a beautiful whisky. In the nose, it shows an awesome harmony, although it lacks intensity. In the mouth it has again a big harmony with a quite diverse range of flavors, but lacks on structure and personality, being just a very pleasent Blend. Would recommend for someone who is searching a Japanese Blend."
"462","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","A worthy bottle to your collection","I think prices are going up due to the hype.  I picked one up for $69 after tasting a flight of japanese whiskies in a local whisky house.  On the nose, the whisky is very floral with notes of sandal wood and sharp fruit, which is almost nail polish like, but in a pleasant way.  On the tongue, the whisky is light with lingering sweetness.  Subtle notes of malt and peat come through on the mid-palate.  I appreciate subtle flavors in both foods and spirits and really like this whisky.  Have this in your collection to appreciate the range of different styles whiskies can offer.  Note that it's not going to be as powerful as your Islays or some bourbons.  "
"463","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Too expensive","A tasty whiskey which has gone up from £50 to £65 in the last 18 months.I won't buy it again at that price.There are many other great whiskies out there at much lower prices."
"464","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Nice . Smooth .easy drinking. ","Nice but not a classic.  Very young but easy going in the palet. Don't not add water it will kill this whiskey. Got as a present and glad I did . I read reports that the price was going up so I brought myself a second bottle for £48.Not worth  £65 "
"465","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Marketing Ploy","At first I thought I tasted a hint of subtlety, but after making it further through my ounce it started to drink like a slightly more balanced Irish whisky (not a good thing).At a much lower price-point it would be an acceptable whisky, but I'm afraid Suntory has dressed up a sub-par dram in a nice bottle and box and called it 'premium'. Avoid unless you're only buying an ounce."
"466","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Breathe it in","So nice. Big fan of this. Almost prefer to sniff it than drink it. Cuts calories and more affordable. "
"467","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","best blend you will find in the current era","If not for the 12 and 17 year old versions existing this hibiki is the best blend around at the moment. It has so much to offer to all, whether you have tried whisky for the first time recently or are a seasoned drinker. This NAS hibiki may have some younger malts than the 12 year old did, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had older too. Its well balanced, friendly and accessible but! never boring. May be a little pricey, but it is unique experience indeed.NoseLots of dried fruit notes including plum, raisin, apricot and perhaps a hint of fruit conserve. Vanilla and floral notes. There is a pickled note in here, not unpleasantly so, but just a little acidity complemented by a marmalade note, cacao and a very faint hint of peat.PaletteSweet wood notes, vanilla, honey develops into a warm spice rich apple and orange note before finishing with some oak woodiness and spiciness, some over-brewed tea and a faint passing note of peat. (Disclaimer, Tasting notes are subjective)   "
"468","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","not a bad drop of whisky","I'm not a whisky buff or a toff, I have had some bunnahabhains and the Shackleton Journey and discovery whiskiesall god damn fine whisky's and all i can say is its distressing that this doesn't come in a 1 litre version, 50cl is just not enough,  but happy to have it in my cabinet, its really nice n fresh to drink, i dont add coke! i dont add water, damn i dont even add ice, i drink my whisky how its poured straight into the glass and then my mouth"
"469","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","underwhelming ","With a blend of both yamasazki and hakistu. You can actully taste both at the exact same time. The problem is it is on where near a good as i was led to belive. if you already have yamaski and hakisu, there is really no need to to get this one. "
"470","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Muah!","A little bit pricey but one of the best blend's I've been drinking.Alot of flavours, caramel, orange peel and alot of more flavours.. I have to try another whisky now so have to end the review right now.."
"471","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Well balanced whisky for all tastes.","Smooth. A good whisky. Very well balanced. "
"472","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Great whisky easy drinking ","Great whisky very easy drinking. However the taste is almost identical to glenmorangie a mid winters night which is half the price. Cool bottle though. "
"473","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Excellent whisky, well worth it. ","If smoky peaty briny single malts are winter, then the Hibiki Harmony is spring. It is light, sweet, bright, fool of fruit.. that citrusy influence that is just...yummy!There are very few whiskies even close in price point that I would rank with this one. "
"474","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","One of the most elegant whiskies I""ve ever drank. ","By far one of the most elegant whiskies. I enjoy it straight with just a splash of cold water. I smell orange, a bit of chocolate and toffee. Very smooth taste with a sweet buttery end. It is complex but not too complex and medium strong. "
"475","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Very pleased with this offering","While this blend from Hibiki does remain smooth from start to finish, it also has a pleasing complexity that makes you want to taste it again. It has a nice finish that lingers softly, which I like, allowing you to easily continue to drink it. I was never one to try and pinpoint every last flavor detail - I leave that to those with a more refined palate, than I. What I value is a whisky that tastes great and is a pleasure to drink in the overall experience. I find that Hibiki Japanese Harmony is exactly that."
"476","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Beautiful!","This is a beautiful whiskey. It is smooth, delicious, sweet and well worth the price. "
"477","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Scottish whisky drinker,' + years ","We opened the bottle and poured a few glassed it smelt really good , we drank it and it also tasted really good . then we had a glass of our local Scottish whisky , then I decided to taste the Japanese Whisky again .BUT  WE WERE all very surprised and SHOCKED to find it was not pleasant to drink after having a SCOTTISH WHISKY .Very Disappointed ????

"479","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Whiskey lover","For the price, it is the best Japanese whiskey out there."
"480","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Car without a motor","Having a get together with the boys. I originally wrote a report on this that was not favourable and said I would let it breathe and report back again. Here it is from the group: Very fruity, cherries and bananas but rather flat overall. No life, no social redeeming value...lack of risk from the distiller. The question was ""would you buy it?"" and the overwhelming response was no. "
"481","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Sweetened high octane vomit","The bottle I got with The Japanese Advent calendar is hopefullt just off. Because this stuff hadn't a light smoky nose and the flavor of cat vomit.  Every sip resulted in gagging.  Had two friends over who are avid whiskey drinkers that tasted it with the same reaction.  Group vote was to pour it out. I spent all evening trying to choke it down hoping it would get better.  It didn't. "
"482","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Not a fan","When I first opened the bottle all I could smell was rubbing alcohol. First glass was not a pleasant experience at all. Very young...sharp, soapy and lacking in flavour. Let it sit for a while and had another glass a few weeks later and although it settled down it still lacks character in my opinion. Having the boys over for a scotch night before Xmas and will report back with some more thoughts."
"483","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Malaysian.","On its own not much alcohol taste but very smooth. Please mix with yamazaki limited edition 2016 and it becomes fantastic. 2 spoonful of each and the formula is just right."
"484","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Hibiki by the name","Honestly this Hibiki is very disapointing. Flat and short."
"485","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Short lived & Non-complex","Young wet wood, very floral, decadent marmalade, spice, vanilla, sugar sweet but thin, short finish. Nice sweet & spicy taste with wood and flowers for aroma. I bit thin and the finish I'd short. Complexity seems to stop at the nose and the taste is a bit of a sweet mess. Reminds me of a brandy. My rating comes down to this. Am I excited to run to my kitchen and gave another dram of it? No. Would I buy it again? Nope."
"486","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Smooth and sweet with the right complexity enjoyale to drink  this pic","Probably one of the better  blended I have tasted at this mid tier range. If smoky scotch isn't for you, this is the one to go for!! "
"487","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","VERY SMOOTH","RECOMMENDED  HIGHLY"
"488","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","VERY VERY SMOOTH","RECOMMENDED"
"489","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Surprisingly good","The initial nose is I think oak and orange together. Followed by more pronounced orange and peppery oak, which is in turn followed by notes of vanilla from the depths. There isn't even the barest hint of alcohol on the nose. The palate is again oak and oranges, followed by orange candy, with some medicinal orange notes. There are only the barest hints of alcohol here, and barely any bite, until the finish.The finish is dry with some hints of toffee showing up in an airing of oranges."
"490","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Worth the price","Pricier than some great single malts (Laphroaig, Ardbeg, Arran), but this is a beautiful blend. Fruity, complex,  smoky, and smooth with a pleasant, numbing bite at the finish. Think of a smokier, fruitier version of Arran 10."
"491","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Initially skeptical - totally won me over after several sessions","Dismissed by many due to its price point as a blend - don't overlook this incredibly light, smooth and floral whisky. Less sweet, more fruity (orange, spice, wood cone through) - don't let the snobs put you off with their wearisome complaints that it 'lacks in complexity' and is 'too sweet'. On the contrary, I'd say this is pure, understated complexity and elegance. Give it a chance - you won't be disappointed. "
"492","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","very nice and smooth","Was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and tasty it was"
"493","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Cloying Sweet","After trying the Hakushu 12yr as my first Japanese Whisky and being blown away, I was eager to try more offerings from Suntory's distilleries. The Hibiki Japanese harmony was the next bottle I grabbed. The nose is promising, slightly floral, with more warmth and spice than the Hakushu. I got slightly woody smells in the nose, but none of the cirtrus or smoke of the Hakushu. Smells very inviting.On the palate sweetness dominates everything. It tasted as if someone dropped a dollop of honey directly on my tongue before the whiskey comes through. With even the sweetest Bourbon, there is generally enough body and flavor to support the sweetness. After the honey there are some interesting and pleasant tasting notes in this whisky, especially those that you can get on the exhale after a good sip. But all the tasting notes here are demure and restrained and subtle, and simply do not stand up to the overwhelming sweetness. At best Hibiki might make a great base for a minimalist cocktail or whisky and club soda. At worst it is simply medicinal in taste and lacking most of the virtues of the other fantastic Japanese Whiskys I've tasted."
"494","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","One of the best blended whisky's I've tasted."
"495","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","hibiki japanese harmony","A truly delicious whiskey.Smooth and satisfying.Even when the nectar has been enjoyed,the glass continues to have a delightful nose of oak and spicy sandalwood."
"496","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Wow","Caramel...almond...toffee...sweet stuff...a little salty. Simple mid palate but really smooth and terrific for the price. I like it better than yamazaki 12 year and nikka pure malt. Great whisky for under $75. "
"497","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Mike","I had never tried Japanese whiskey before; Master of Malt led me to Japanese Harmony. Thank you!! It's, without doubt, one of the tastiest, most memorable whiskeys I've ever had the privilege to savour!"
"498","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Not as good as Hibiki 12","...and a pale shadow of the Hibiki 17 :-(The nose is promising but the palate and finish is a little unbalanced (dare I say unharmonious?)Saddens me it's almost impossible to find a bottle of Hibiki 17 or even Hibiki 12 nowadays."

"500","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","This is a great whisky ","Super smooth flavour"
"501","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Fabulous whiskey ","A super smooth flavour very enjoyable light n lovely one of my favourites "
"502","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Mmmmm....","...not sure about this one. On the plus side, it has lovely fruit fragrance, with herby and woody notes. It has a pleasant mouth feel but the strongest impression is sweetness, and a little too much of this.  "
"503","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Very good","Caramel nose. Lots of orange on first taste but less thereafter. Vanilla and floral. Oaky finish.  Pleased"
"504","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Eager to taste","Based on what I've heard this should be a satisfying whisky"
"505","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Interesting!","Nose is mostly plum...I also got white chocolate on the cork. Palate continues to be very fruity, flowery....I did not get orange, but more like apricot. A note I could not place till I read the review that said hibiscus...that's it! A touch of malt. Finish is a bit woody, burnt almost? I see that many have given kinda low ratings....the thing to remember is that this is a blend, not a malt. You rarely see this kind of complexity in a blend. So all good with me, you don't like the flavor profile, that's one thing...doesn't mean the whisky is bad, so long as it does what it sets out to do.  However, this is my second Japanese whisky and I'll say this....this is definitely not as good as the Nikka from the barrel!"
"506","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Awesome Blend!","Not usually a fan of blended whiskey, but this one set me on my ear!"
"507","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Smooth n nice flavour ","Super "
"508","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Excellent and Light","Looking at those mediocre reviews I compared  Hibiki 17 and Nikka WHISKEY FROM THE BARREL and Light Harmony all Japanese whiskys. Light Harmony is an excellent light whiskey that can be served to all, even those who try Whiskey for the very first time and women are included.No one will be turned off. Many whiskey connoisseurs lost their taste to stinky taste of peat like LAPHROAIG or Smoky Lagavulin.If you like to try light refreshing whisky without strong aftertaste look no further."
"509","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","The Art for money","A good balance between the 12 & the 21 year "
"510","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Light, floral notes, but lingering sweetness is overwhelming.","A whisky with an inviting nose, notes of honey, hibiscus, and subtle vanilla.  Upon first taste all other senses are overwhelmed by the sweet taste that remains.  Some 30 minutes after completing my dram it still feels like I have a lollipop in my mouth.  Texture is thin.  In all honesty, I expected more."
"511","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Excellent","Simply one of the best"
"512","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Floral whisky","Unique. Floral. Certainly not smokey. Is smooth but could give a hangover unlike Scottish Scothches.  "
"513","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Almost Drinkable","So sweet. Kind of tastes like cough syrup, orange peel and a stale caramel. First sip...ok, this is different. Second sip...not sure if I like this. Third sip...yuck, give me something to rinse my palate and give me some real whiskey so that my taste buds don't sue me for abuse.This is an embarrassing whiskey for Suntory. I hope that it gets pulled from the shelves soon because it is giving them a bad name."
"514","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","So-so at best","Color: Rich and deep in amber character, but clearly contains caramel due to the hue of the whisky: in conjunction with the flavor, which is curiously sweet and does not linger on the tongue, I'm convinced there is caramel coloring in the drink. Aroma: Fruity with notes of pear and banana, very delicate notes of marshmallow and caramelized sugars; notes of toasted cinnamon and raisin bread, but very subdued. There is an aspect of charcoal but also very subdued and does not present alongside the phenolic notes of the malt, but rather with the more fruity flavor as would be found with a bourbon. Overall, the nose is lacking in pungency and has no truly distinctive notes over many other less expensive Japanese blends.Taste and texture: Texture is thicker than Ardbeg and coats that glass in a pleasant way, but the taste is forgettable and doesn't linger in the mouth nearly long enough to be pleasurable. The flavors themselves immediately remind me of Nikka From The Barrel (51%) but without the distinction and pungency of Nikka's honey flavor.Both of Suntory's malts, Hakushu and Yamazaki, present strongly in Japanese Harmony, but their effect is less pleasant than in the 12 Year Old Hibiki: the Hakushu blend, which is exceptionally sweet and has notes of pine and earthy flavors not found in other peated whiskys like Ardbeg or Laphraoig, is overwhelmed by the acidity and acridness of the Yamazaki malt, which tends to be more spicy and possesses the cinnamon characteristics that present in Japanese Harmony. The end result is a whiskey has the potential to be fantastic, but falls short in terms of the potency and longevity of the flavor in the mouth. Would not recommend; would recommend in its place the Hibiki 12 which has more palatable honey notes, Nikka From The Barrel (51%) which has rounder fruity profiles as well as a more distinct and pleasant fruit notes, or Hakushu 12 which is surprisingly refreshing and has exceptionally balanced flavor profile between sweet and earthy."
"515","Hibiki Japanese Harmony","Hibiki","Quite nice","Quite smooth and not peaty.  A bit on the floral / fruit side. A touch of burn that goes down with a sip.  Absolutely enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.  Other than that it was a bit pricey, I would strongly suggest it to others.  "

"524","Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master's Select","Hibiki","Plain and ordinary whisky","Bought a bottle at Changi. Drank it over 6 months. Initially not too bad, however it got painful to drink this whisky. It is just an ordinary whisky. Other single malts costing less than this are far better value.Definitely not buying any more of the Suntory ""drop down mixes""Its a shame because the Yamazaki Single Malt 12 Year old is a smashing whisky"
"525","Hibiki Japanese Harmony Master's Select","Hibiki","Outstanding & surprisingly sophisticated blend","Picked up a bottle after being offered a taste at Otopeni airport (Bucharest, RO). The well balanced, delicate flavour combinations along with a very smooth finish were an absolute revelation to me, as I was only accustomed to Scottish and American brands.I didn't hesitate to make the purchase at about 70eu, which I think was a steal for this kind of quality.Highly recommended if you haven't tried Japanese whisky before!

I couldn't help but feel like a big shot and king of the world, if only for an hour, sipping patiently this most wonderful blend that I'd argue could stand up to the strongest single malts. Elements of chocolate, toffee, pear, oak and a hint of smoke tell an entire story as it morphs across the palette. Extraordinary whisky whilst top of the world...if only for a few fleeting moments.

Smooth long finish with custard cream and rhubarb on the nose, hints of cherry and plums in there as well.  This is an adult version of your favourite childhood cordial.  However I'm not sure it's worth that much more than the 12.  Certainly smoother but I think I'd prefer two 70cl of the 12 rather than one of these. "
"548","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Could smell it all day!","It's interesting to read how different people describe this whisky so differently. For me, the nose was of full of fruit, in particular dark cherries. Fantastic. The palate is sweet and velvety smooth with more fruit/cherry giving way to a bit of vanilla spiciness & oaken body. More please."
"549","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","The nose is in a league of its own","A cracking whisky, much better than many single malts at the same price. Probably my favourite bottle design too, and such a sweet, easy-drinking dram.   "
"550","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","The Echo Of Sound","Sweet aromatic wood chips dipped in a simple syrup. Banana leaf, plantain and madagascar vanilla. Lemon peel, toffee cereal with no peat and subtle on the palate.  Soft floral notes, smooth, and rich with  body. Exceptionally enjoyable and definitely will buy another bottle. Love what Japanese whiskies bring to the table. "
"551","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Pleasant surprise!","The best blended whisky in the world at this <20 age statement! Way better than Chivas Regal 18 and the likes in my opinion. It's beyond belief how rich this whisky is and yet so mellow at the same time. I'm an Islay malt lifelong devotee, so this Hibiki 17 was definitely a pleasant surprise. "
"552","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Shared with good friends and...","It just doesn't get much better.Always a fan of the single malts, this is without a doubt worthy, despite the name (Scotch) omission. Splendid.Cheers"
"553","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Sublime","Like any good whisky, this gets better the more you taste. Wonderful spice on the nose, clean, fresh slightly woody taste, and very long spicy finish. Sublime stuff indeed. I've never been to Japan, but this brings to mind some of the tastes and smells I would expect if I visited...very clever, and very Japanese...wet wood, flowers gardens after rain, and a fragrance that is so sensual. And as a little bonus, it comes in a very stylish bottle indeed. Highly recommended without reservation. "
"554","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Wow","Have just stacked this up against my favourite Scotch - a Talisker dark storm, which I thought was a bit of an improvement over the original, and this Hibiki just demolishes it. Very mellow and straightfoward. The Talisker was brutal, but then I like them harsh. This was anything but - a real pleasure to sip on, and you can taste the effort they put into it. I've tried a few Japanese scotches, all the way up to the Yamazaki 25, which was a bit treacley, but as it was the dowry for my wife, it served its purpose and went down well. I would still rate this Hibiki 17 well above it. These guys did a great job. Enjoy. "

"561","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Suntory Gold","This is my 2nd review of this whiskey, and for good reason.It's initial impact is citrus followed quickly by sweeter honey tones, the after taste lingers long enough to satisfy but short enough not to intrude. The Blend that's achieved puts a certain Blue Label to shame and, quite easily at that.I enjoy a peaty whiskey emensely, of which this isn't but it does deliver on every scale, the price you pay respects the drink you drink, if you're at all unsure, please take the plunge, if you're not happy ill come to yours and drink the remainder for you."

"563","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","97/100","I did not expect to like this as much as i have, sipping on some now.  The nose is unique to anything I have had before - spice and floral blossom alongside pine and oak with beeswax, one of the most interesting noses that will have you inhaling it for a long time, there are tones of smoke, and leaf alongside notes of rich vanilla and citrus leaf.  The taste is as good, an initial intense spice with chili leads into a more beguiling sensation of baked tropical fruits, bananas toffee, slight peaty smokiness which I wasn't expecting, more spice and eventual mellowing over well balanced cream, spice and fruit.  I can't  believe how good this is, almost as good as some of my favourite Scottish single malts! and better than a lot of the Scottish blends.  Unbelievable..."

"566","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Good and Unique","A review by Tommy ByrneOverall rating: 7,5/10 - Good and UniqueAs many western whisky enthusiasts, I discovered the Suntory whisky brand a few years ago thanks to Bill Murray’s sells pitch in Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translations: “For relaxing times, make it Suntory time”. Having first tried the Yamazaki 12 years old Single Malt, I had huge expectations from the brand who made me forget it was not actually drinking a true scotch whisky.Swirling in my very favourite Glencairn glass, the old gold fluid already let you know you are dealing with an almost full body whisky. Starting with some dried bananas and apricots nosing notes, honeydew and pineapple soon appear after the first sip. While the toasted barley and dry fruits blends in with balance to an insinuation of toffee in the palate, I found it a little too sharp for a 17 years old whisky. However, the addition of a drop of water will definitely make up for it. Reaching the finishing line, we know we are dealing with a fine-aged product, it last remarkably in the mouth, reminding you that you are drinking a hundred dollar whisky.I’ve never been a strong fan of scotch-type blended whiskies; they always seem to lack of a true essence and hide their original personality. Why blend this sweet nectar with an obscure array of distilled spirits, when the angels delightfully take their shares in the untainted form? Then again, let’s be clear, the 17 years old version of Suntory Hibiki is a great product made with a thorough process by Japanese master blenders who have perfectly reproduced the style and character of a Speyside whisky to my sense. Being an unconditional devotee to Islay Malts, I think that a stronger hint of peat would really transform this whisky into what some have already branded it: “The best whisky in the world”."

This was one of the nicest blends I've tried, and one I will keep on my shelf to share with my friends.  It is very smooth, and finishes neatly.  It is light, but surprisingly complex.  A slight oak flavor with a little bit of smoke, but not over powering.  Definately a keeper."
"570","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Excellent Whisky","This is a very full, rich and lingering whisky. A bit on the sweeter, dried-fruit end. Every time I poured a glass I was impressed by how amenable the Hibiki 17 was — Highly recommended!

"572","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Is it Malt or Blend?","I thought i saw blended whisky is it a blend or a malt blend??"
"573","Hibiki 17 Year Old","Hibiki","Coals to Newcastle?","This is one of the fines drops I have tried, Having tried, Royal Salute, Blue label at nearly 3 times the cost, I have to say the Japs could teach the Scotts a thing or too, how to do it better and cheaper, oh and the bottle. Superb! One of the best Malts you will try for the price."

"581","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Delicious, hands down my favorite blend by a long shot","Absolutely incredible stuff, a big step up from the already excellent 17yo, it's hard to describe just how balanced and delicious this whisky is. The nose is sweet, nutty, with vanilla, toffee and some sherry. The mouthfeel is so smooth, and there's a beautiful mix of fruity sweetness, caramel, oak and just a hint of smoke on the palate, all balanced in perfect proportion. A nice long, oaky finish that stays with you for a good while. I've tried other blends including the much touted JW Blue, but honestly there is no contest between it and Hibiki 21, and that's no exaggeration. Every bit as good as its reputation, and well worth trying if you every find yourself with the opportunity to do so. Unfortunately this is nearly impossible to find in a liquor store these days, and if you do find it it will be at a substantial (>$500 USD) markup, but if you see it at a bar and have $100 to burn, treat yourself to a glass, you won't be disappointed."
"582","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Perfection. ","Tried this and the 30 yo at the Yamazaki Distillery in Japan, and knew I had to own a bottle. Low and behold KIX airport duty free. Best blended by a longshot. "
"583","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Get it while you can ...","I just ordered a bottle at $430.  My colleague in Japan said that older malts are becoming scarce, and Suntory is moving from 10 year and 12 year to very young bottlings."
"584","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","simply unreal","something so fascinating has to be tried! looking for a bottle of my own at this moment! found 1 so far but it is over $400"
"585","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Marvelous","It really bloomed and opened up once some air hit it.  Smooth and complex.  Toffee almond prune raisin.  Rich but balanced.  Nice stuff.  I like it better than the 17.  And I paid twice as much !!! At the above price its a steal but you will never find it at that price again.  Buy it anyway.  Nice addition to any Japanese whisky collection.  "
"586","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","The Goods","Lives up to all the hype. I way over paid because I had to see what all the fuss was. Not as complex as I was hoping but the best blended whisky I've had. Like it better than Ballantines. Great nose. Long finish. Suntory got it right. If you can get this for less than $300 it's a steal. All Suntory is overpriced but this stuff stands up to the best."
"587","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Amazing but insanely hard to find","Had it once . Best 21 yo out there by far. Only problem is getting a hold of it. Hibiki of any variant is insanely hard to get ahold of. Still got my bottle of 12, and harmony but I'd really love to get my hands on another one of these. It blows everything else out of the water. I'd love to know when yall will have another shipment "
"588","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","WWWWOOOWWW!","To get completely consistent reviews like this... is amazing... and my one tastes proves them right.Exactly JW Blue is PISS!  Would not waste a penny on that crap."
"589","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Caramel delight","A splash of water and a little time in the glass really intensified the caramel flavour. Quite an amazing whisky. "
"590","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Amazing","Had this in a whiskey bar in Japan.  Drank it back to back with a JW Blue and made the blue taste like piss!  It was ridiculous.  I saw there is a 30 year available above this... I'm worried by head would explode from ecstasy from drinking that if the 21 is already soooo ridiculously good.  "

"593","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Sublime","An absolute joy.It's a pity that it is so rare nowadays."
"594","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","Without doubt in a class all it's own, 'Sublime'","Rarely found now, even in Japan, this whisky redefines all preconceptions of how a blended whisky compares with the finest Single Malts.  Have enjoyed Scotch across the spectrum for over 40 years, from common to legendary, and I tell you fellow single malt and blended lovers, this is it!  It's a shocking 49 pounds UK for a double in the higher end bars in Tokyo, but worth it if you have never tried it, trust me.  I secured a 700 ml for 125 pounds UK at the renown Hasegawa, whilst here on vacation and consider myself extremely lucky to add this to my collection.  If you have the opportunity to have a dram or two, don't hesitate to try it; it will 'Rock your world!'"
"595","Hibiki 21 Year Old","Hibiki","A Very Fine Drink Indeed..","I'm a single malt man, have been my whole life...though I have enjoyed a few quality blended Scotches like Top End Chivas/Dimple in my time, I never thought I  would try anything around this price that matches the quality and taste of my Favorite Single Malts - Glenfiddich 21 Gran Reserva and Glenfarclas 25. But this was something special, its nearly too smooth with the most delightful finish on the palate, Buttery with subtle oakey smoke hints, it has this perfectly sweet initial toffee/caramel flavor when it first touches your lips and the lasting taste that is everything i want in a fine Scotch. My favorite drink is now Hibiki 21 Year Old blended scotch, after 15 years of enjoying single malts, this one drink changed my opinion forever. It's that good."

"607","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Hibiki 12 Fan","The first Japanese whisky that I tried - and although I have tried better since (namely the Yamazaki 12) this is still one of my favourites. Fantastic. I have also bought a bottle of the Hibiki 17 but I'm saving that for a special occasion!"
"608","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Go with the 17 yo instead","Quite bland if you ask me. It really needs those extra years you get in the 17 yo to fully develop the Hibiki characteristics. "
"609","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Konichiwa","Japansk single malt och även nu blend konkurrerar helt ut den övriga marknaden. Fantastiska smaker och med is känner man verkligen hur smakerna lyfter. Skotsk whiskey blir på sin höjd kyld men inget mer. Hakushu, yamazaki, yoichi och nu även denna munsbit. Trist att Systembolaget i Sverige inte har den på hyllan, dom skulle nog ha det. Den går dock att beställa från Systembolaget."
"610","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Wakarimazda!","Rich, complex and sweetness from the plum. One of the best whiskies i ever tasted, but ice makes It even flavours. Just the bottle is worth buying."
"611","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","sayonara","Complex and smooth at the same time, no 12 y.o scotch blend is even near this in terms of quality."
"612","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","The rising sun strikes again","I first heard of The Suntory distillery on the booze traveler on the travel channel. After Jack Maxwell disclosed the place for me I was immediately captivated and absolutely and to try some. yes it is pricey yes it does sell very fast, even on the internet. The Japanese are a very advanced culture and their whiskey is no exception. This stuff can easy put the best of Lynchburg, Tennessee to shame."
"613","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Dr","Absolutely smooth and full flavoured. Fully recommended"
"614","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","blends just aren't like single malts ","For a 12yr  blend it is superb. Yamazaki 12yr is better because it has a full complex body. When you  try this compare it to other blends not single malts. But the fact is it's  still better than most 12yr single malt Scotland whiskeys "
"615","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","The future.","Good, a litle thin nose but the plum saves it all. Love the fresh fruity tastes of the Japanese whiskies.This one is the best blens I ever tasted. "
"616","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Love for Japan.","Just the bottle design is worth it!"
"617","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","It´s a blend not a single malt.","Fantastic! A bit thin nose, but I like that in this blend. The plum save it all. Love the frutiness and the cherry, plum of the Japanese whiskies. Its a blend, not a single malt. "
"618","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","LOVE IT!!!!!","I wish I bought all of the bottles off of the shelf!"
"619","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Hi!!!","Även Japansk blend håller en överlägsen klass. Jag är imponerad över vilka smaker de får fram, har inte känt dess like i någon Skottska Whiskey trots 25 år av provande. Köp!!!"
"620","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Inconsistent labeling","I am, as we speak drinking  Hibiki 12 year old scotch.  On this webpage, labeling for the nose, palate, and finish are very different from that on the box in front of me. Haven't had that much yet, really."
"621","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","a wonderful whisky for those....","a wonderful whisky for those who appreciate some refined subtleness in their drink. those who prefer a kick in the senses should probable look somewhere else. The Hibki is elegant and bodied with aromas full of sweet fruit and roasted nut slight cherry/plum oakiness. add a touch of water, and the layers of aroma changes, magnificent. "
"622","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Disappointing","Definietly drinkable, but like some of the other reviewers have pointed out, it is quite flat and nothing special at all.  I had heard a lot about Japanese whisky and was eager to try it but was ultimately left feeling disappointed."
"623","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Magical!","First taste is a oak, followed by apricot, plum, and rose. Finished with complex smokey hues of burnt cherry. Some whiskeys just have the magic factor, and this one does. Needs to be drunk from a large open whiskey glass with a wide bowl. Swirl a few times to open it up and start with the fragrance. Needs a couple of minutes to get the full effect. Magical!"
"624","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Nice Pack, Lovely Bottle.","Received as a gift from my Japanese friend Mr. Jinya , but I have to give this to my any non Muslim friend as Alcohol is strictly prohibited in my religion.  "
"625","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Boring","Bought this on a whim as the price was right ($59).   That being said, it left me very flat.  A bit of a let down for my first Japanese distilled whisky. "
"626","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Very ok","Just ok and non descript.  Opens up with a bit of water, but nothing to write home about. "
"627","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Lovely stuff","Just yummy. Brings a smile to my face. "
"628","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","hibiki 17 year old","recently drank this brand in barcelona spain best scotch i ever had"
"629","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","No scotch for this man","Not a fan of scotch but love bourbon.  Hibiki is a wonderful mix of the two that is quite unique and peppery. My first taste was in Tokyo 5 years ago and took it neat.  Needs ice and an ever-so slight splash of water and you found heaven."
"630","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","well balanced & entertaining","color:  golden ambernose:  herbal and fruity,  oaky, bourbon like nosepalate:  fruity delivery quickly gives way to honey and dried fruitfinish:  medium length,  oaky notes at the endA well balanced and entertaining whisky"
"631","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Renaissance","Il me laisse sans voix : arôme, saveur, fort et doux à la fois. J'en boirai ... trop  !  Juste parfait."
"632","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Wow.  Just Wow.","Very smooth.  Tasty."
"633","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Konichiwa Delicious!","just wow, I mean, wow. like the dew drops on a leave in a forest morning, this drop is like gods tears. I really pitched a tent after this sauce. it was like a geisha had caressed my cubes. 10 out of 10 for slurpability"
"634","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Simply the best!","My son is an experienced barman. He knows whiskies and bought me this for my birthday. Honestly, I have had a load of different malts and this one is right up there with the best. Indeed, it's one of the few that I would go out of my way to replace. I've just poured the last dram. Shame."
"635","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Very nice","As far av premium blends go, this ranks as one of the best for me.Very good all around indeed.Will buy again - and not just for the nice bottle."
"636","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Ok, but wont be buying again.","The nose is very strong on this, and not pleasant to what i am accustom to enjoying on the nose with my scotches normally.I bought this because i had seen some good reviews and if nothing else it has a beautiful bottle.After cracking open the bottle throwing a few cubes of ice in my glass and pouring into the glass i enjoyed 3 completely different tastes from this whiskey. Initially very pronounced flavors with an incredibly smooth finish. After a the whiskey started to cool off in the ice  the warm smooth finish was toned down and replaced with a much more subtle flavor with very little bite, however that incredibly smooth finish was now not the forefront of this whiskey. As the ice began to melt a bit it changed the flavor again, making every ounce of the flavor of the whiskey really pop out for me. I enjoyed it overall, however the unpleasant nose on this whiskey is one that will cause me to stay away from hibiki for future purchases. I will stick to my highland scotches"
"637","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Best Whiskey Ever","By far the smoothest blended whisky...."
"638","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Echoing that rum & raisin nose","just like to echo Steve McGiff's notes, I couldn't stop smelling this whisky and I knew I recognised the smell, rum & raisin ice cream, 2 bottles in and I decided to try the 17 year old which I found even nicer.  Both great."
"639","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","batman","ok noting wrong with the bottle MOM plz remove my last review spent a bit more time with this whisky just not for me.Something different a change worth a try."
"640","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","batman ","just receive a bottle of this today and 3 others only get to open 2 so my benromach 10 just wonderfull i open this hibiki and not to impressed the bottom of the cork is a differnt colour to the rest of the cork darker maybe that is it or its not to my taste any help lads"
"641","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Its a tie... ","After 12 rounds and many a sore head.... and many light weight encounters as well.... its went to points...... Yamazaki 95% Hibiki 95% .... nothing can separate these two 12 year olds... not even price.... maybe the Hibiki shades it on the bottle! (I use it to collect £1 coins in to funds my whiskey purchasing adventures) But you cant have a bottle style help...... If so Id never have bought the All Malt.... which is a frontrunner at £10 less.... Jason Breen"
"642","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","The Japanese beauty that turned my head!","I'm a USAmerican, and (admittedly) a ""snob"" when it comes to malt-based liquor; I won't drink whiskey unless it's from the island of Ireland, and -- until now -- I wouldn't drink Scotch whisky unless it was from Scotland. (The bourbon-type liquors sold under those monikers by North American producers is, in my experience and to my palate, too inferior to deserve the name.) But when my spouse and I went to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants recently, the server mentioned they had recently added ""a Japanese scotch"" to their offerings, and we were too intrigued not to inquire further. The bartender brought over the lovely decanter, I asked to smell the cork... and it was love at first whiff! We enjoyed a dram of it together (neither of us are remotely heavy drinkers) and found it to make an excellent ""sipping whiskey"" with its profound complexity and warm sweetness. That it could have done with a touch less ""fire"" is my only criticism; though it's entirely possible my palate had simply grown unaccustomed to ""neat"" liquor again, as I mainly imbibe scotch and whiskey in the colder months, when I drink it at all. Though my preference is always for unadulterated scotch and whiskey, I did try the Hibiki 12 Year Old with water after a while, and the completely different array of complexly-layered flavors and aroma made me fall in love all over again! I can't recommend this blend highly enough -- for those who enjoy fine scotch and/or whiskey in the first place -- and will definitely consider acquiring a bottle of my own... even though, at the rate I drink, it would likely last a lifetime."
"643","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Well worth the money!","Beautiful decanter for a bottle and the juice inside is worthy of such a sexy bottle. Oranges, Marmalade and Plums, Nutty honey & sponge cake!"
"644","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Suntory Hibiki 12","Smell and taste: ume plum wine (umeshu), pineapple and honey, very sweet.If you don't like whiskey maybe you like this."
"645","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","George - Hibiki 12","Sophisticated and exotic, Hibiki exudes the most wonderful collection of aromas and tastes. As a student, this one is very special and it will be a while before I can work my up through the range but if this is anything to go by, it will be worth the wait! Nose: Spring blossom and green freshness. Notes of plum and exotic spices (lotus, ginger?). Hint of raspberry, honey and sweet maltiness. Palate: Strong but subtle, extremely fragrant and sweet, balanced by spicy ginger and oak notes. Lively and velvet smooth with defined vanilla and honey notes. Cereal sweetness is held in check by more robust oak and rich exotic fruitiness, particularly raspberry and plum. Finish: Very long, sweet with an enduring spiciness - you are left in no doubt that you have had something very special.    "
"646","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Wow","Firstly the bottle i thought was very impressive.But what got me most was the nose, seriously i couldn't stop smelling it.The taste was very busy, but in a remarkable manner.Layer's of taste's Going back to the nose, i got bag's of rum and raison ice creamThe vanilla was abundant.Smooth clean taste, distinctive to the japanese.I just loved it, smiled with every sniff and taste.......     Stephen McGiff,      Cornwall......"
"647","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Anticipation","I have a bottle of this, awaiting my arrival homecannot wait to taste itI am getting a very big respect for japanese whiskeyYamazaki, 10yr, 12 yr,18 yr, are remarkableI could  not stop smelling the dramVery moorish indeed.......Steve mcGiff, cornwall........."
"648","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","Loved it !","Now this is a whiskey, where every single drop counts. Very very smooth, sweet and fruity. The finish is just going and going and going...:D Japanese are obviously the masters and perfectionists in everything they touch. Go get your own bottle, this one is mine :D. "
"649","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","A gem","This is an absolute peach of a dram. It is distinctly Japanese and has something really special about it. I'd thoroughly recommend it; a good one for blind tastings."
"650","Hibiki 12 Year Old","Hibiki","delicious ","I've tasted a few Japanese drams so far and none were disappointing! This one was the best by far.This Hibiki 12 Year Old is a so-called premium blend, because it contains (besides grain whisky as packer) no less than 30 different single malts that are at least 12 years of age, topped off with a 30-year old! The dram has matured on Japanese oak first and finished in so-called Umeshu cask, previously used for the maturing of Japan's famous plum brandy.The whole went through a process of charcoal filtering - through bamboo wood no less - that gives the whole it's mellow, soft taste.It was launched in 2009 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Suntory Hibiki distillery.The influence of the Umeshu cask is clearly detectable on the nose. Apart from plum, raspberry and pineapple, one also gets hit by very sweet honey and a truckload of vanilla.On the palate, a duel is going on between the oak and the barley. What a body. Very good indeed.The finish is nicely spiced and long. The sweet oak prevents the dram from burning down your throat.Mmmm very moreish.The word 'Hibiki' has several meanings in Japanese, one of them being 'harmonious'. That's a good way to describe this premium blend. Available at other retailers for around £45."
"651","Hibiki 12 Year Old 50cl","Hibiki","Totally Tropical Taste","My initial impression took me back to Asia - fresh fruits like pineapple that have been ripening in the tropical sun!    Definitely a different experience to what I have had before.  Very well-balanced and there is a 'plummyness' that really comes through.  Most enjoyable - however, it must be said my bottle was a gift - would I pay £40 for it?  No - which is a shame!"
"652","Hibiki 12 Year Old 50cl","Hibiki","Wonderful.","One of the best blends on the planet,far better than any of JW's I have tried(inc the Blue).The down side it's a bit pricey, but have to pay for quality."
"653","Hibiki 12 Year Old 50cl","Hibiki","Great whisky","Bought a bottle in japan, at a duty free shop. Very smooth stuff.  "
"654","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Burn Baby Burn","Got a small bottle from the Family Mart to drink at the ryokan. Anyone saying this is smooth either had a different batch, is lying, or has never had smooth whiskey. Hidden behind the sharp alcohol burn is a good lightly smokey flavor, but DAMN, this stuff is not easy."
"655","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Excellent and smooth","Exceptionally smooth, inoffensive stuff.  Really enjoyed it for the price."
"656","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Bad stuff","With 5 drinking persons we could not even finish the bottle. Not smooth , only thing you can feel is ethyl alcohol . For that high price - awful . No better than cheapest Johnny Walker... "
"657","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Bang on","Master of Malt's tasting notes are bang on about this one. Call me crazy but for me it is similar to Bushmills 10 year old single malt, which is one of my all time favorites. "

"660","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","for any single malt fan it is worth buying a bottle ","Brilliant single malt whisky.  Right up there with the best scotch you can buy if not better."
"661","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","An absolute triumph well worth buying","This is such a beautiful, delicate and satisfying whisky. I've offered this to many people who think they don't like whisky and they've really enjoyed it.One of my all time favourites due to it's subtly & distinctiveness. I've got a cupboard full of bottles but my wife can identify this without any help."

"666","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Grassy, citrussy, tasty","Having tried both the Distiller's Reserve and the Hakushu 12, I would say that your money is better spent on this expression. Further evidence that age statements aren't necessarily the 'best'...This a really pleasant and enjoyable whisky, and if you tend to prefer mellower flavours (or are averse to peat) then this will be right down your street. It's still got plenty of sophistication and complexity, mind you: just in subtler areas. I'd say that it's perfect for drinking in warmer weather. Lovely stuff."
"667","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Too Good","This whisky was so good I drank two thirds of the bottle in one night (very unlike me), woke up the next morning with a raging hangover and now I can't touch the stuff.Would definitely recommend to anyone who has never had a Japanese whisky but doesn't have the budget for a Yamazaki or the 12 YO, different to any scotch/irish/other single malt. It's also probably worth splashing out on even if it's slightly outside your usual budget (like it was mine) as I can't think of a single scotch in this price range which beats it."

"671","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","All things green. ","This great Japanese single malt is full of all things green on both the nose and palate. Green fruits, herbs, mint, melon and cucumber abound. The nose is a delightful green medley of more things than I can easily discern. It's utterly mouthwatering on the tongue and any smoke is very light and not easy to detect. Not cheap by any means but a great entry level Japanese single malt. Highly recommended.  "
"672","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Look out Scotland!","The chill from the Japanese alps, a shy taste of smoke. Great!"
"673","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","A 'Smokey Speyside'","This whisky is light, smooth, and mellow, with all the attributes of a Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or (honey/lemon) on the palate, but with a subtle smokey finish. Delightful!"
"674","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","A superb drop for the money...","...with some delicate and very unusual fruit flavours that you just don't find in a Scotch malt coming through at the end, possibly as a result of the Mizunara oak. And whilst it's not exactly Ardbeg, if the reviewer below can't detect the peat (or the fruit, for that matter) he needs his tastebuds examined, and if anyone thinks this is too sweet I can only guess that they've never tasted a Speyside or sherried whisky before. I'm guessing restraint and subtlety just aren't his things. "
"675","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Sugared almonds","Nearing the end of the bottle (shows how easy it is to drink) but I wont buy again. ZERO green notes, citrus/ cucumber etc, ZERO Peat. What there is in abundance is coconut ice, maple syrup fudge, golden syrup - its just too sugary for me.Says it all when M.O.M conclude their tasteing notes suggesting it would make a greta highball."
"676","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","lapin rouge","Entry level (8 yrs?) malt - so there is an edge to it and very little complexity. Dont believe any of the marketing-speak about 'green herbs' 'yuzu' or 'Cucumber' - but maybe, perhaps there is smoke on the finish if you imagine really hard.The reality is it's an excellent drinking whiskey, a well deserved glass in the evening. And maybe another glass after that. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"677","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","Nice with a capital ""N""","Think of a bath of hot water to soak in. Some you lower yourself gently into as you need to get used to it before you enjoy it. You know the style 2/3 tastes maybe more. The you go Haaaaaaaa nice.This is a single malt that has already been checked tested and you just get in there and soak from the 1st sip to getting out clean and refreshed.It's Japanese precision. Personally no hidden corners, no shocks, no surprises.However don't get me wrong it's comfort incarnate. Favourite film,slippers and music score.   "
"678","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","A good alternative Hakushu","A good alternative to the 12 year old, this can be had for as little as €20-25 if you search out alternative off-licences and suburban department stores in Tokyo and its environs. Quite an accomplished whisky for the price and perhaps even a little less ubiquitous than its bigger and more expensive 12 year old brother."
"679","The Hakushu Single Malt Whisky - Distiller’s Reserve","Hakushu","like bathing in a Japanese spring","Perfectly described, seriously good drop.Very easy to get stuck into.The peat delicately arrives after lashings of mint and melon, mmmmmSteve McGiff....Cornwall.."
"680","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Great Japanese Whisky","Hakushu 12, unlike the Yamazaki 12 & discontinued Hibiki & Yoichi 12 yr olds, is still somewhat available in the U.S. (specifically California).  Overall, I find the subtle hints of smokiness on the nose & palate (really not a whole lot of smoke) make Hakushu 12 much more interesting and enjoyable than other Japanese whiskies in the same price range.  The subtle peat smoke lingers in the background and really enhances all the mostly fruity notes that dominate.  Probably a great teaser for the uninitiated of the joys that peated whisky can bring. "
"681","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","An especially nice whisky","Given the eye-watering prices these days I sometimes suspect producers are taking the mick. Would have thought this well worth fifty quid, however, but then again it’s more to my taste than Highland Park 18 at a comparable price and not far behind my favourite Balvenie 21 at much more.  "
"682","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Great whiskey!","This is a great whisky. The Japaneses oak offers a rich and unique taste that you will not find in other whiskeys. it's something to savor. If your used to Irish, Scotch, American. You will be glad of the experience. "
"683","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","A Japanese forest in a bottle","Intense flavors of forest and spice with a nice subtle smoke lingering. Great stuff but it comes at a price. Is it worth the price of most 18yo bottles out there? Maybe.... worth a try for anyone who likes stuff like glenfiddich. This is my go to when I want a clean fresh scotch. Id give it a 5 but that is reserved for a scotch that makes me want to never drink anything else."
"684","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Good whiskey to try. ","Nice flavor, very light and smooth compared to some other single malts. I'd say it is a good buy at or around $50. I wouldn't pay higher than that. "

"686","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Outstanding, refreshing ","I don't know all of those big words that the experts use, but I save this for special occasions, when the snow is falling and the fire is crackling.

"689","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","What a fresh Nose!","I just bought a bottle of  Hakushu 12 to celebrate the birth of my 2nd child and daughter and decided on this whisky.  Man, am I impressed!Probably the freshest nose I've experienced.  I always roll my eyes when people nose a whisky and then say something silly like, ""smells of a rolling meadow...blah blah blah"".  But his whisky...wow, consider me a changed man.  I actually felt like the nose transported me to a quiet Japanese forest.  I found the taste to be clean, just sweet enough and just peaty enough.  Kinda like a sweet terpentine (if that sounds good at all to you...which it probably shouldnt?)  After a minute or so of airing out, it became an amazingly smooth drink.  The harsh edge of the peat rolled off a bit and it transformed into something gulpable - which I wouldnt consider the cost!But all in all, I am impressed and this will for sure be a staple in cabinet. "
"690","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Bamboo Charcoal filtered","I think the Hakushu whiskies have  a very distinct and original profile and are the ones that least resemble Scotch of all the Japanese I've tasted so far.At first it was a bit rough but it rally opens up halfway after a few months..."
"691","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Just Delightful","I did a blind tasting of the distillers reserve, 12 year, and 18 year old Hakushu.  The 12 year was the clear winner of the three for me.  The 12 year was more delicate and had more subtle under notes and layers than the other two.  This will always be a staple in my world whiskey collection. "
"692","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Excellent ","There seems to be a lot of reviewers with elementary grammar commenting on these specialized whiskys, the truth is you may spend good money on on a well crafted whisky you simply don't like, it's all it the eye of the taster, but before you tear down a finely crafted product like Hakushu you should take more time to understand the complexity of regional whisky."

"694","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Too much expensive!!","Very too much expensive for these quality. Of course, a nice product, but not at this price. Yes, it is subtle, fruity...and taste good. But I refuse to buy speculative whiskey."
"695","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Beautiful","This is the first Japanese Wiskey I've tried (but I have lots of experience of Scotch), it's absolutely wonderful!  I adore Coal Ila, and Bruichladdich.  This is right up their with them.  Hard to say it's worth $75 a bottle, but it's definitely a lovely whiskey!"
"696","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Expensive","Too expensive for a 12 year japanese whisky. Not good at all."
"697","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","very refined for a 12 year old.","a Bowmore, ehhhhh......... the Hakushu is much more subtle and layered, perfect for a clear, cool day, or a rainy night and you're inclined to calm things down with the essence & aroma of  the gentle forest breeze, slightly pear fruity, hints of almond, fresh grass and clean, clear water from the alps. This is refined whisky, not really for those who enjoy their jack daniels with coke."
"698","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","overrated","Too expensive and it doesn't feel like a 12 yo at all. Get a Bowmore 12 instead. Half the price and you get a well rounded whisky that doesn't taste like alcohol. I have tried plenty of Japanese whisky and this one of the worst."

"705","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Fresh and teriffic","This is all beach-grass with a bonfire off in the distance.  Wish I had a Yamazaki to taste against, but on its own, just terrific.  No sherry cloying, smoke only the very faintest, none of the ""whiskey distillery"" taste that you get in even the lightest Oban and Scapa scotches.  Seriously, it's all a day at a secluded beach.  Really like nothing I've ever had before.  Underappreciated IMO.  It's $65 in Texas and well worth it.  At $110 I'd still even consider it, just for its simplicity and uniqueness."
"706","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Amazing","I drank this with Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12 and the winner was Hakushu 12. Cant beleve that this guy s age is only 12 OMG"
"707","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Chief","I don't believe it! Upon opening the bottle and pouring, two comments from about the room were to the effect ""what stinks""? Not only does it have a strong odor, but also really a lot of bite. Might be better at 40% (80 Proof).Texas Single Malt Whisky and inexpensive single malt Irish and Scotch are much more enjoyable."

"710","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","How much?","After trying this in a restaurant at the weekend, I genuinely thought this was a whisky worth £100 or more. £55 is a bargain. I can tell you that this whisky compares excellently with the smoother peaty expressions from Islay or Campbeltown. The smell alone is worth the entry fee. "
"711","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","Sweet, smooth goodness","This is a sweet and smooth whisky with gentle, easy notes. Easy sipping. No water needed. Love it."
"712","Hakushu 12 Year Old","Hakushu","what a 12yo!","What a cracking little malt this is. Very fresh and crisp, the smoke is very subtle and comes to the fore over the time of the drink - it builds and builds but is light and really compliments the lightness of the drink. Lovely thick mouthfeel, and medium finish which is sweet. This is now my top summer whisky and possibly the best 12 year old I've ever had. Complexity of a malt much, much old...maybe up there with 18yo's"

"715","Hakushu 18 Year Old","Hakushu","Surprising for someone whos not a fan of the 12","I never really rated Hakushu 12. It was decent but a bit harsh and no where near as harmonious as say a Hibiki or a Taketsuru.. This made the 18 a revelation! Smooth and caremelly with a fruity nose, it was an absolute delight. However, once my ice melted into it sub stantially, the nose went off and chemical notes started coming in. Thus only 4 stars"
"716","Hakushu 18 Year Old","Hakushu","Reasonably good","While I dont think it is as great as many make it out to be this is a really nice whisky"
"717","Hakushu 18 Year Old","Hakushu","Turning Japanese...","...I really think so.More and more I discover these wonderful Japanese whiskies, after a disastrous tasting of a Yoichi in Scotland last year. I am now convinced that was an unfortunate one-off, as everything I've sampled recently has been a revelation. This is sharp, fresh, lingering sweetness, apples, pears, and fresh cut flowers. Just gorgeous, clean and deeply tasty. Recommended."
"718","Hakushu 18 Year Old","Hakushu","One of the very best","Goes straight up to my top 10 list... Every Whiskylover should try this one!  "
"719","Hakushu 18 Year Old","Hakushu","Not a patch on it's younger brother","I've had this on my purchase list for a long time and once it came back in stock I jumped on it. I'm a massive fan of Japanese whisky, having had pretty much every mainstream bottling on offer, and a big fan of the 12yo Hakushu (probably my favourite). I found this a little underwhelming really. It's much more complex than the 12 as you would expect and the oak is just about right but it lacks balance and the finish just isn't as good as the 12. It seems that the best parts of the 12 have been lost with the extra years and the vibrancy and dance you get from the 12 Hakushu just isn't there. Glad I bought one but I would chose the 12 over this in a heartbeat....which makes me a little sad inside."

"722","Hakushu 25 Year Old ","Hakushu","Simply Sublime","light amber in color, nose of subtle peat and subtle white oak, flavors explodes in your mouth yet restraint in an understated elegance, soft white oak, silky and round, with spicy but long finish.  Tremendous power and finesse with long elegant finish.  I wonder if this is the Japanese oak they've been talking about?  The taste remind me of eating best Toro Sushi, i.e. subtle silky flavors to meditate and be inspired!  This style is so different than the overtly sweet sherry oak stuff.  This is sublime.  96 points.  This got #1 spot out of Macallan 25 #2 and Yamazaki 25 #3.  Trio of 25-year-old's compared side by side at the Yamazaki Distillery, for about US$ 29 per shot, (maybe less than a ""shot?)"

"727","Hakushu Bourbon Barrel","Hakushu","IFLWhisky review","Firstly, I love Japanese whisky. It just makes me feel like Bill Murray every time I pick one up. Pathetically hoping that Scarlet Johansson will come along and form some weird sexual bond with me.Hakushu is Suntory's Shinobi. A silent assassin. He lurks, patiently waiting to make his move. Using well practiced Uzura Gakure techniques (possibly learned from Robert the Bruce), he entices you in. Using a scent that will convince you that only yourself and nature, occupy the Earth. Once he makes his move, his use of weaponry is textbook (possibly weapons made in Kentucky). But he daren't break the rules. The job is done with so much as a flicker of an eyelid. In a somewhat jilted manner, he performs his ritualistic engagement and then surrenders you, leaving only one laceration...the one that keeps you coming back for more. After a good execution, this Shinobi hits the gut with a proud smile on his face, but always knowing he could have done better.This whisky is soft on the nose, full of citrus and floral notes, morning dew, and parma violets, with a slightly peated whiff. On the palate it just floats. Peachy fucking creamy. It grows and lingers with a taste of dried fruits, salty buttercream, and a dryness that is somewhat reminiscent of a Japanese lager. All in all, this is a wonderful whisky. Easy drinking, but it isn't going to change the world. Like the girl your Mother warned you about; you know you are selling yourself short, but fuck it, you're having a great time… Until something better comes along!"
"728","Hakushu Bourbon Barrel","Hakushu","baboonish delicious","This one is awesome. As creamy as it can get, balanced and sweet. Bananas all the way, but not unpleasing. One of my favourites!"
"729","Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%","Hakushu","The Green Tea of Japanese Whisky","Fresh mint, green tea, a fresh breeze in the shade on a sunny day.  That's what I get from this one. Super unique. Delicate. Haiku in a glass.  One of my favorite Japanese whiskys and I've tried most of them."
"730","Hakushu 12 Year Old 43.5%","Hakushu","Subtle, balanced","Hakushu is a peated Japanese whiskey made from a non-peated and a heavily peated malt. The result is a whiskey with a fine balance of earthy flavors and smoke, without a heavy taste of phenols or the more iodine flavors found in Islay whiskeys. Despite being filtered with charcoal and bamboo filters, the spirit has very little bourbon or charcoal flavors in it. Very sweet, very refined, with little acidity and a lower alcohol content than is typical of peated whiskeys. Flavors of lemon, smoke, green tea, and a salinity which reminds me of soy sauces and teriyaki flavors; there's a flavor of pine or pine needles, and the taste of how autumn leaves smell. There's also something in the center of the palate that reminds me very much of Suntory's blended Hibiki, which uses both the Hakushu and Yamazaki malts - it's a sourness, and a peated flavor which is distinct in Suntory's blends, and absolutely delicious. Balance of sour and sweet flavors, tempered with the smoky and earthy quality. Color is desirably dark without being obviously altered by caramel e150 - though to my knowledge, there is caramel coloring in this whiskey. Overall, would highly recommend this malt if you're looking for a great summer whiskey to be enjoyed on the rocks or as a highball. While some of the flavor profile completely disappears with the presence of water, the smokiness and more pine flavors are retained and become prominent in the malt, making it a highly refreshing spirit for warmer days.

They're over 3000 yen if you can even manage to find them now.  There's really something unique about the way they marry aged malt and grain whiskies and then further age the mixture in wood.  It sets this whisky apart.  The closest thing I've found to compare this to is the Cutty Sark Prohibition.  But it's not really in the same class.  If you see these anywhere, I'd suggest grabbing them (or telling me where they are)."

"742","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Magical (to me of course).","It tastes like Scotch but there's something different about it. After drinking it I realized it's a blend, for the grain element is married flawlessly into it. Full bodied and pleasant, 51.4% but you wouldn't tell that from the nose or undiluted taste. Add a bit of water and it will release some aromas that weren't there before. I admit, I approached this one with skepticism, ""yeah Japanese, what do they know"" and I was thought a lesson: Japanese can turn anything into art.This one is really special, even if it's sold in 500ml bottles."

It is nicely balanced, although I hate to say I found it a little ""boring"" for my taste.

But when you do, it's actually pretty cheap ($20 or $25).  And it's worth every penny/yen.  It's rich, complex, and full-flavored.  Sure, it does have an 'edge' that older whiskies usually don't, but don't let that turn you off.  It's not a bad thing.  This whisky has ""something special"".  It punches well above its weight.  Enjoy it if you have the chance. "

Really pronounced on the palate - baked orange and pineapple, josticks, prunes, hay, sandalwood, tobacco, cedar - evolves.  Long, complex finish - phenolics, coffee, all sorts really.

"764","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","you bet.","They build a great whiskey ."
"765","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Bang for buck","Not a dram to rival the true greats but a very pleasant sipping whisky and in terms of quality for cost it's, pound for pound, the best value foreign whisky on the market.A must have for any decent drinks cabinet."
"766","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Exelent","My favourite blend so far. Fairly spicy and very interesting taste. This is in no way a boring whisky."
"767","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","try this one","I have tried one bottle just by chance when I was in Yokouska  in 2016 without doing any research on the product and I was pleasantly surprised. I would recommend to any serious whiskey consumer to try this one, you wont be disappointed.  "
"768","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Umami!","Has everything one would want in a proper whisky; it's sweet, salty, fruity, bitter, and little smokey. The balance between these flavours is absolutely superb. It hits not just the tip or the side of your tongue, it attacks the whole damned muscle. It's a hell of a dram and there's only one word that can define properly: UMAMI!"
"769","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Simple.. delicious... whisky ","So, I've been a whisky drinker for years, and it's easy to get caught up between Scotch and a bourbon flavoured liquor. There's a clear difference between Nikka and other whiskys, maybe Its the price point, it is a very high quality drop. The flavours are smooth, warm caramel with a rose scent, delivers a smooth, vanilla palet that takes you a journey from first sip to the last. I've mixed Nikka with cola, stired between sips with a spoon.. for some strange reason beyond my expertise the drink turns to a light brown colour which is in between cola and whisky more towards the bottom end of the glass. I mix the single barrel Nikka with ice cubes as with all my whiskys and the journey is worth telling my story "
"770","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","gentle power","My favourite blended,  a smooth all rounder, with punch and character. "
"771","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Like being smacked in the face.","From the outset, you can smell it's slightly stronger than usual. It's a proper punch of flavour. Slightly unrefined but still plenty to offer. It's spicy in the mouth and certainly not like a smooth malt. The finish lasts into the middle of next week. This is my first Japanese whisky and I will certainly buy more. It's a fun drink to be enjoyed with friends.  Not a quiet contemplator. "
"772","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Quality is fading","Sadly this is not as good as it was 2 years ago. The whiskey tastes very very young. This used to be my favorite go-to whiskey. I hope my bottle mellows in the coming months as it oxidizes..."
"773","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Terrific value in such a small bottle.","Sitting in a Ryokan in Shibu Onsen it tastes pretty good to me.I bought this on impulse in Nagano on our way here and first sip confirms what great value this drop is.For an unaged bottling it really does have a character you'd associate with much more expensive Japanese whisky and I'll be bringing more of this home with me if i can find it again ."
"774","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","looong finish, satisfying blend, take your time with this one","Color: GoldenNose: 	Sweet, honey, apples, melon, liquorice, mint, chocolatePalate: 	After brushing teeth: dry/sweet entry, light, hints of fruity aroma, liquorice, spicy, lemonFinish: 	Slightly bitter, sweet, long and warmAlthough 500ml bottle is a little small, 51% makes up for some of it. Good whisky neat without any water added, flavors are complex, lots of oak and fruit, honey. Very spicy even after having it sits for 30min. great whisky to sip on with a long finish, can savor of the flavor long after swallowing. "
"775","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","I would recommend this over highland park 18 if cost is an issue. HP 18 has a better flavour profile but only marginally. Nikka's higher ABV wins me over.","Excellent value for money.  A truly exceptional scotch that rivals highland park 18. Higher ABV with a very pleasant flavour profile. "
"776","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","splendido","This is about as good as affordable blends get, but the real star of the Nikka line-up is, alas, not on your site.Their Yoichi single malt 500ml, which I filled up my suitcase with on the way back from Japan last year is spectacularly good - drinkable everyday without ever getting tired of it.... And for around AUD65 thanks to low taxes, it's truly sinful."
"777","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Like a Cognac/Scotch Crossover","I tried it at a house party and went to buy two 500ml bottles of it. It is a like Cognac crossing over a *VERY fruity Speyside. Stewed apple/pear with a hint of orange in a syrup; some floral, spices, vanilla/bubble gum on the side.  Overall, For $51 CAD it is value-for-money, solid, and great if you want a Speyside but more fruity and *decisively differnt*. "
"778","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","awesomeness in a bottle","Everything you need and want to know about whisky is locked in this cute bottle. If one person is permitted a bottle of whisky only, there is no other i will want !  Nikka Pure malt (white) is equally good.   "
"779","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Smooth Wonderfulness","After falling in love with Nikka ""The One"" I thought I would give this a go and it is superb. Smooth, Syrup like with a wonderful sweet toffee like finish. Superb."
"780","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Very Impressed","My first Japanese Whisky and it sure did not disappoint.  Great nose, palate and finish.  Only  wish we could get a larger bottle in the States."
"781","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","No better ","I've sampled a LOT of malts over time but Nikka from the Barrel surpasses the lot.Thick, bold, aromatic .. this has it all. Ditch any illusion you may have that whisky must come from the Glen ... this is something to behold. I know I'm gushing but this really IS that good. "
"782","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","And breathe","Had some at an English distillery sampling, had a variety of the English which were from OK to yuk to yummy, then was given Nikka as an experiment. Citricous and wafts of flavour if allowed to sit a while. Bought some English and a bottle of this. Blooming loved it with water and neat,, perhaps preferred with a thimble of water more. But definitely worth a purchase. "

"784","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Hard to keep a bottle for long","Liked it since the first time I tried it, and for that price not much can beat it. Yet again time to get another bottle!"
"785","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Give it some time, give it some water","First expression of this whisky for me was horrible, I was thinking that something must had gone wrong... And something did, the way I drank it.This beverage requires some time, be very cautions with water as you can overdrown this easily while trying to down its alcohol content. Give it a spoon of water & wait, and after 10 minutes, try it out slowly, let your nose and mouth to get accustomed to alcohol, and you would discover its rich taste.Very interesting experience, but unfortunately has a Japan whisky price, which are a little bit overpriced."
"786","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Great!  And difficult to ""peg"" into a category","I first tasted this at the Whisky Show at Old Billingsgate in 2016.  Was ""spot on"" with nose, flavor, and aftertaste.  Bought one bottle, and drank it so fast, I missed the nuances.  Ordered two more, and will give you a more thorough review in two weeks.  Overall, an enormously strong, complex, and flavorful whisky, with plenty of fruitiness, and totally irresistible. "
"787","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","What a whisky!!","BUY this whisky, its incredible value for money. Im a total novice in whisky, but here are my notes! I næsen: Syrlige frugter, Apelsin skrald og frugtsalatMunden: Frugt, OAK, mandel og et hint af karamel.""Nose: Elegant fruits like in a fruit salat, leaning more towards citrus fruits/orange peel. Slightly sweet and also nutty, almonds. Mouth: Fruits follow through, then come almonds/nuts and a hint of caramel. At the end a little dry and rather oaky! "
"788","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Very Good","My 2nd Japanese, after Hibiki 12, and I'm very impressed, again!Agree with poster below - this is thick!  Wonderfully so.  Lots of tropical fruit, spice and almost buttery on the palate.  Lovely mouth-feel and a long sweet syrupy finish with a touch of wood spice dryness.    I like a few drops of water in this but it can be drunk without no problem.  Considering rising prices this is an excellent value whisky from Japan!  Recommended."
"789","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Delicious and surprising","It tastes almost ""thick"" - wonderful and unexpected. Not at all like a Scotch, but even more different than any Bourbon. Enormous character."
"790","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Stunning","Not much more to say really but you have to try this what a whisky and a real good price"

"792","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","facebook.com/maltmondays - my online whisky blog","@maltmondaysThe Nose. Is predictably strong, a hard hit of alcohol, however once your nose adjusts the complexity does cut through, intense hits of brown sugar, rum & raisins. Fruit plays a big part in the nature of this whisky. The nose has a great mix of spice and fruit, think a whole orange poked with star anise before placing in your winter mulled wine pot!  The Taste. Has all the traits the nose implies, caramelized cooked fruits, Toffee, Sticky, buttery-ness on the tongue. That welcome spice hits back too, it’s a 5-spice and Asian cuisine style heat. This is a big mouthful, don’t be intimidated by the strength, let it linger until you get that beautiful mouthful of Christmas pudding and warm winter desserts.   The Finish. Thankfully this does the taste justice, long, smooth and very warming. There’s some Oak maturity too which is a nice contrast to the Fruit. Ginger and cinnamon hints arise after a few seconds and they are very welcome! The rich spice stays long after you’ve had a few drams and walked away from this drop. Something I found hard to do.   "

"794","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Wow!","Wish I knew about this before. My first whisky from Japan, and wow! What a surprise, had it in a sushi bar after dessert.Now, I am not that much of an expert in these matters, but this is one of those drams that could easily be mistaken for a malt and given that appropriate score. Try it out. Well worth it."
"795","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Oak!","Slight oak? Really? This smells strong oak. Almost like a mix between a bourbon and rum."
"796","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Wow, I was not expecting this","First tried Nikka last year, the first taste was a pleasant surprise. I have never been able to describe the taste of Whisky in the way many experts have done, however flowers and many other fragrance's are evident together with a slight oak. It's one to savour. "
"797","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","You should try it.","This really is amazing stuff. I've paid three times the price for whisky that wasn't this good. If all whisky was free, i'f give it a 9/10, but since price is a factor for most of us, I'll give it a 10/10. You can't go wrong with this one. Once again the MOM tasting notes are dead on. I will buy more when this bottle is gone. "

Definitely under tones of vanilla and citrus, I found it a little harsh, but I'm coming from 21yr Royal Salute - which is very smooth!I'm taking one the gents previous post advise and let it breath for 20....no doubt I'll be raving afterwards 😉👍"
"801","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","A good strong cask strength.","A very delicate whisky; some caramel and honey overtones. I don't seem to love it as much as others but it's still enjoyable. Good price point too and excellent stand out packaging."

"808","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","A real treat","A real treat this little beauty. It's not often a blended whisky takes your breath away but this is a real all guns blazing belter of a find.

"810","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Remarkably good","Given the price that this retails at this is fantastic and would hold its own against most. Loved it. Smooth. Lots of caramel and toffee flavours. "
"811","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","First time Japanese and really Impressed ","This was the only decent Japanese whiskey with a decent price in my location. So tried this. I am glad I did buy this one. It's one of a kind. Initial notes of caramel, toffee and at the back the alcohol and smoke hits you in a good way. It's something unique that I have not tasted in any other whiskey. Needs teaspoon of water to open it up and be a little bit more mellow The bottle although looks nice is a pain to pour the whiskey. You lose some drops trying to pour to a glass. Too bad considering this is a small bottle and I don't like to waste a single drop. "
"812","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Virginal experience","Tried this whisky for the first time tonight and what a triumph!  Caramel, yes, and smoothness in great measure. I hadn't tried Japanese whisky before but consider me hooked.  I'm almost tempted to go downstairs for another sipped shot but might have to plump for sleep.  Well done, Tokyo."

"816","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Why Not!! Nikka Whiskey","Let it rest and then enjoy.. This whiskey kicks many more expensive bottles out of the park... If you haven't tried it yet then my question to you is simple... Why Not!!"
"817","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Opening it up","For me, this is one of the very best blended whisky ever produced. Over the years blended whiskies have improved so much and this is a fine example of that. It's a complex whisky that opens up beautifully with around 15ml of water (or 1 small ice cube) for the 50ml double - it also helps because of the alcohol content. It really is like opening a hidden box of flavours within the drink. Really do love this whisky, very delicious. It's a 4 out 5 simply because in the grand scheme of things it can never quite make it to the summit, it's stuck at base camp 4... very commendable just not quite the real McCoy. "
"818","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Horrible","I didn't like it. Nothing against a Whisky from Scotland or Ireland..."

"821","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","I love this!","Thank you!"
"822","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Outstanding, sweet, complex, smooth, amazing","I was absolutely shocked by this one. initially i got a burbon-esque nose off it, very sweet, slightly oily. In the mouth its fantastically fruity with a hint of malt, and a good kick of alchol but without killing off any of the flavour. Sweet apple, toffee, some red berries and a little biscuit malt are the dominant flavours, along with subtle vanilla and a hint of citrus.Vanilla and chocolate comes through in the finish along with the berries. Its almost like a delicious juicy chocolate and berry cake!I cannot wait to get a bottle of this for myself, but I'm also nervous that it wont even last one sitting!"
"823","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Abaot the ""nikka from the barrel"" ","It was my first encounter with any whiskies from Japan. Pleasant surprise. I have to confess I am a believer with the isley, but I found this good! G.Róna"
"824","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Not bad","Am no expert. For me, whisky is either nice or disgusting. This falls into the former. It doesn't make me screw my face up as it's smooth on the palate and it's a warm and comforting drink. Nice."
"825","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Pleasantly surprised!","Was given a sample of whiskey during a shopping trip and fell in love immediately. Bought a Nikka Whiskey From The Barrel and one of the Pure Malt. Just opened the whiskey from the barrel and love it. So much more complex than I expected. Is it time for another yet?:)"
"826","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Astonishing depth for a blend","Picked it up at the duty free yesterday and having the first drink. First up, the bottle is brilliant even though it's only .5l, it reminds me of moonshine jars.When you open the bottle, the alcohol overpowers the nose, so you've got to let it breathe.Add a few drops of water to the glass, let it swirl for a few minutes before the first sip. The nose then feels a lot like a good bourbon. The first sip is smoky, even herbal, almost like an Islay. Bourbon and vanilla in the background, but traces, only traces. Whisky for the darkest winter night. The finish is decently long, astringent, almost like pine and menthol. Touch of woodyness. That was 15 minutes ago. Now it seems to have smoothed with the flavor profile reversed. Bourbon, toffee, vanila, a touch of fruits (not as much as a Speyside) to the fore, the smokyness comes through in the background. The finish is clovery.This is one of those whiskys that will give you a different experience as you work your way down the bottle. Absolute gem, brilliant structure and depth for a high ABV, and to think its a blend. Scotch blends can eat their hearts out - Black Dog and Jonny Walkers ain't got nothing on this one. As good as a top single malt. One word - brilliant."
"827","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Great Value and Flavors","During these dark times of high prices and low availability of Japanese whiskies in general this is a great bang for the buck. Offers some strong intense flavors that can be enjoyed neat but can be further opened up and savored with the addition of time and bit of water. "

"833","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Simpy amazing...","This time I bought two bottles :) "
"834","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Pour, sniff, allow to breathe. Sniff, drink, enjoy, repeat.","This is my first venture into japanese juice so I did not know what to expect. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even after japanese. I was after an Aberlour A'Bunadh 60 caliber but my go-to danish/german bordershop was out (same shop where I got the Balvenie 16y peated cask. Yum yum).It's a 51.4 caliber blend as most might already know.From the bottle into the GlenCairne: Quite a bit alcohol in the nose, which is no surprice due the the number printet at the bottle. So it has to rest for while. Then nice stuff rise from the glass. I get cinnamon and plums and orange. Christmas is in my nose. As the initial alcohol wears off, a pleasant sweetness adds to the nose. My first thought was candyfloss so now I get that every time. Smoke is completely absent.Sipping it, the surprise does start: I'd expect quite a tickling on the lips and tongue from the high percentage, but it's gentle and caressing and doesn't burn at all. It's fruit on the palate along with a more peppery spiciness. A very fullbodied taste that completely fills my mouth and intensivates when exhaling through the sniffing device. Finish: Very sweet yet warming but quite short (I know that some says it's long but not I). Which is fine, because then you just pour once again and start from the beginning. Only downside: It's just 50 cl. so you'll be out of ammo in no time. Thank God, they make so much of the that they are selling it !"
"835","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Fantastic!!!","As all Japanese whiskies, this is just great and I just love the bottle."
"836","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","I must admit is a really good whisky and good value for money,and I was never disappointed  with it yet.to Poor man's Aberlour a'Bunadh.You can't compare it to a'Bunadh..because it's a totally different stuff! It's like to compering a dick to  a door handle."
"837","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Extraordinary and fabulous!!!","For me this is same quality level with Yamazaki 18YO but much more affordable price, great value!"
"838","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Burn, From the Barrel","Got a sample to try, and from a neat pour the nose at first was overpowered with the alcohol, so any notes were confused at first. But eventually vanilla bean, custard, and a faint hint of spice and musty, wet oak came thru. The sweet toffeed palate has a healthy burn. And the finish is perfectly long and oaky, but still a little hot with a touch of grassiness at the end.Very Japanese and very enjoyable in its own right. But this dram doesn't hold the heat from the 51.4% well. "
"839","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Incredibly clean with a nice gentle burn.","Tried this in a bar once, was my first Japanese Whisky. One of my all time favorites now, goes down like water but has a nice gentle burn after. Some great tastes. "
"840","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Still one of my favorites","I was fortunate to get a dram of this in an Asian Whiskey tasting.  For me, the Nikka stood out above the others, I had to get myself a bottle.  About 1/3 of a way through the bottle, and it's still one of my absolute favorites."
"841","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","I yield!","After all these years of looking down on blends I finally and gladly raise the white flag to this little stunner. I am disarmed and I willingly surrender... Marvelous."
"842","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Possibly the most underrated Whisky.","I have no doubt that in a blind taste test with much pricier, prestigious Whiskies, this unassuming little bottle would more than hold it's own. This would surly get a few discerning nods on the nose alone. Aroma science could be learnt from this dram alone it's that complex, but pleasurable too. Once you sip this stuff you can you can expect rapture. If you hadn't already guessed this would definitely be my Whisky of choice. It somehow manages to combine all the best attributes of Bourbon and Scotch. There's not much smoke going on here but everything else is covered, and done with sublime execution. All the things I look for in a good whisky are here. Vanilla first, followed by rich marmalade and dried fruit, followed by the best spice that doesn't have any peppery burn just luscious fruitcake spices. The finish Remains fruity but now it is rich caramelised Orange and chocolate for good measure. This is a true gourmand whisky. I'm not sure where Nikka are sourcing their barrels from but they are possibly the best barrels around. The Japanese sure know how to make whisky. If you like whisky, get this glorious liquid perfection. "
"843","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","One of a kind","By far the most memorable Japanese whisky I've tried. If you're a bourbon fan like me, you'll love it.  Rich, flavoursome, delicious and unbelievably good value."
"844","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Caramelised banana","Is the first thing I discern from my bottle I bought some years ago on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. The alcohol burn slowly creeps up on you but never gets particularly harsh. A definite grassy aftertaste, with something milder than peat (muddy puddle?) around the edges. "
"845","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Japanese Wonder","Well this whisky knows how to make an impact. Just a quick sniff will tell you this is a whisky which will pack a punch. Notes of oak and spice and a little smoke come through. At first sip you'll notice the impact of the 51% abv without it being too overwhelming which is impressive. A big taste of oak and even a little malt come through with some warming pepper which continues onto the finish with a little smokey hints. It's yet another example of why Japanese whiskies should be tried and taken seriously as a quality drink."
"846","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Yabba dabba doo!","Sometimes whiskies just come and slap you in the face and tell you that all of your previous beliefs about things. This is a big hit of ripe rich fruitcake and toasted almonds. Cinnamon and nutmeg notes add to the complexity. It's huge on flavour and that body and intensity along with the quality of spirit hide that 51% alcohol which seems to be smooth and soft in texture. It's Japanese, and it's a blend and it's totally awesome!"
"847","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Excellent","This is a complex and demanding whisky. The nose entices with clove, lemon, satsuma, and honey. The palate mixes ginger, oak, vanilla, toffee, and blackcurrant. The finish is very long, with clove, black pepper, and fruity sweetness. The character of this whisky changes significantly with a little air, too. It softens and sweetens. Nikka is a new favourite!"
"848","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","A Japanese Delight","Nose: Treacle toffee, Icing sugar, Golden syrup, orange zest, dried fruit, apricot, a hint of smoke, buttermilk, some black tea and coffee.Palate: Toffee, vanilla, honey, cocoa, mixed fruit preserves, Jam tarts, some cinnamon, orange fruit juice and some creamy notes.Finish: A long and initially sweet finish with notes of almond, oak, some pepper spice and crisp fruit which turns increasingly dry into the close."
"849","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Impressive","Four of us compared this creation to the first half of the premium whisky calendar, so far it's got second place.I also like the shape of the compact bottle."
"850","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","A blocky little samurai bottling full of japanese spirit","I bought this for a song in Tokyo, but it's worth searching out at the slightly higher price it's sold for abroad (MoM's pricing is pretty good, IMO). A high ABV blend that showcases good, inexpensive Japanese whisky. I'd also suggest that the idiosyncratic, miminalist bottling means this works well as a gift option."
"851","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Unreal ","So well made that you would think you are drinking a 40 percent whisky. Smooth, powerful and delicious. Should be ten times the price. Amazing "
"852","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","First nose","...would suggest a bourbon. Smells very sweet and fruity Its arrived at work and staring at me from under the monitor.  Cant wait to get home.  Love the clinical packaging.  "

"855","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Good indeed","Very highly recommended. Nice oiliness with spicy toffee and complex fruitiness. The blended whisky at so high strength is rarity, although this is probably not a cask strength whisky. "

"858","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Winner","have enjoyed a few Japanese whiskies in my time. found a bottle of this by chance at the hotel I was staying at. since then I've made sure the barman keeps the bottle hidden until my return. well worth it"
"859","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","great service ","Bought this yesterday lunchtime as a gift, and it arrived perfectly packaged before 9am today! Very impressed, just hope the whisky is as good as the reviews say it is!"
"860","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Entrepreneur ","I bought this whiskey not knowing anything about it! I saw a promotion online. Myself and my business partner have just opened this, and we are absolutely blown away. We just wish it came in a 750ml"
"861","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Poor man's Aberlour a'Bunadh","Similar nose to Aberlour a'Bunadh, but weaker arrival and finish.  (And it's more expensive.)"
"862","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Mr fm Grimley","Nokia 21 pure malt. Up there with some of the west coast malts in Scotland. Full bodied fruity and crisp. Beautiful bottle only downside is a malt of this quality must have a cork not a screw top cap 10 out of 10."
"863","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Also fantastic packaging","Pretty packaging also.."
"864","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Flipping great","Got a bottle from local wine shop ( he has a decent whiskey range) and this Stuff is fantastic sure it's 50cl but 30 quid, for cask strength.. Great Japanese floral style and a big punch... Certainly a replacement for for cupboard job when gone. Top stuff and a bargin."
"865","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Recommended","Based on the Pure Malt White - though it's a good whisky - I wasn't really in a hurry to try this and so it's been sitting around for a couple months, but now I regret not getting to it sooner. Love the palate especially. Great price, but amazing whisky regardless."
"866","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Would be a 10","Amazing dram. Would be a perfect ten if it were 70cl. "
"867","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Very impressed","Wow! Firstly can I say what amazing service master of malt gives . I ordered  my bottle on a Monday eve and it was delivered tues when delivery was advised  by fri so very impressed.  It was packaged well so no chance of damage and the whiskey is presented in a chic black box which made me think what an excellent gift this would be for someone as the price is on point. However this time the gift was for me. Having worked in japan I understand their love of whisky which  is also where I picked up my taste for it. I hadn't tried this brand before but have to say I will def be purchasing again. Smooth but with a hitch of heat that leaves a delightful sensation as well as flavour. This yes please for me and will be recommending this website to everyone I know!!!!"
"868","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Day 3 of the Whisky Advent Calendar: My first ever Japanese","I've never tried Japanese whisky before and until recently was oblivious to the fact that they're a renowned whisky producing nation. Absolutely the best blended whisky I've ever experienced. I don't see how this can be compared with a smoky, pungent Talisker. Such a lovely, spicy and woody aroma - I've kept a small drop in my Glencairn just to keep coming back to it without the alcohol hit."
"869","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","wasn't expecting a big bite","I'm a bourbon lover, enjoy scotch, and also enjoy white dog. I found this to have a bit more heat than expected.I also bought a bottle of Super and hope it is a bit smoother."
"870","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","slightly changed since my last review","Interesting. My previous bottle (2012) was distinctly sugared almonds. This time (2013) the packaging has changed & its generally drier with more attack - I suspect less aging which is a shame. Nose is remarkable - goes on and on. On the palate however that fierce attack is too much, a minty mouth numbing sensation, perhaps peat but no smoke. aftertaste is somewhat killed by the burning sensation."
"871","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","forgot to rate it!","Forgot the 10 stars it deserves!"
"872","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Really Loved It! ","What can I say, I am not an expert of whiskey by any stretch of the imagination (although I have drunk all sorts) but it clearly came across this was really good.I would highly recommend you try this beauty!!!"
"873","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","To try!","A basic japanese whisky with an amazing rapport quality/price !!!Highly recommended especially for novices who want to discover the Japanese whiskey."
"874","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","And here is my rating (missing from above..doh!)","Only losing points for not being as focused as my preferred single malts, and having a distinct Kentucky feel to it. How they likened it to Talisker and not makers mark is a poor reflection on the shop staff. That not withstanding, I would never have considered trying it without their shnaffoo, so can't really grumble. Fallen on a diamond in the ruff. "
"875","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","All of the above...and then some!","Fairly new to the drink myself and currently working through the classic malts. I found this on quest for Oban (which is going to have to wait)and bought it as the store keeper picked up on my love of Talisker and said I'd like this. It is NOTHING like talisker but, I DO love this! I rarely take my drink neat but this is different. I was snobbish about blends, but again, this is different. Its nose is rich and pungent but very bourbon like. I was immediately reminded of makers mark dipped cigars. But on the tongue it has so many flavors, the one that stands out is licorice root. WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?? I could sniff this all day but I am afraid it might be addictive. I've just started on my whiskey shelf at home and this is going to be a show stopper. Can't wait to share it with loved ones. "

"878","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","I wrote just getting familiar above","And now I know for sure why many rave about this.  It really is fantastic.  Last night I was taking those prefect hummingbird sized drop-sips, and I really experienced the texture and amazing flavor of this whisky.  I have yet to try with a drop of water, but I don't know how soon I will, because it is fantastic neat,.and a prefect slow sipper.  Again, maybe bc of strength, but I find the buzz from this unique and very desirable.  Now I'm trying to figure out how I might b able to get more than the 4 I already have into my suitcase along with: yoichi and miyagikyo no age statements, nikka 12 year pure malt, yamazaki 10 yr single malt, Yoichi 10 , and Miyagikyo 10."

"880","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Just getting familiar","scared at first when I nosed one of the bottles i bought here in Japan, because it is strronng. But now when I open the bottle for a sniff, wow, very much bourbon like sweetness, can't wait to experiment with small drops of water with small servings of this whisky to see what that does. But I generally like to drink neat, and so I do here. The nose can be so wonderful and I detect lovely favors on the tongue with a fiery sensation on the way down.  But at over 50% that is to be expected..all I know so far is that I like this whisky more and more with each try.  And the buzz is very very nice..Does anyone from m.o.m. or anywhere else know if it is true that this and other tasty whiskies really have color added? I don't even know if that has a bad connotation to it; and even tho the majority of reviews online have people saying they love this whisky (and many say it is one of the best bargain quality whiskies in the world), one guy didn't have nice things to say and added that this was another dram with color added.	 Anyone privy?"
"881","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Not just a conversation piece!!","Bought this as a bit of a conversation piece but boy was I happy I had. Love this stuff. Simply great. Will need more soon."
"882","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Maltmanswe","Simply the best blended whisky you will find, no discussion."
"883","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Absolutely Delicious ","I am far from a whiskey connoisseur but I have to write this review, I had my first taste of Whisky in the form of Johnnie Walker about 6 months ago, from that moment I knew I had found my goto alcohol to unwind and relax with. Since that moment 6 months ago I have tried Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, Famous Grouse, Talisker and Jamesons. I thought I had Whisky pegged, but I just got this today and I can honestly say its the best whiskey Ive tasted so far, it hits your mouth like Johnnie Walker but the taste a few seconds after is amazing, it almost turns into a liquor taste as the flavour becomes very creamy, but still packs the amazing feeling drinking whisky gives. Like I said I'm no where near an expert on this stuff, but to topple all those other brands Ive tasted, this whisky is something special."
"884","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Wonderful. Bourbon influence, remarkable value ","Incredible value for an exceptional whiskey. Matured in Bourbon hogsheads I imagine because it's heading in that direction - not a 'Scotch' wannabe in any way. Despite strength (50%?) its smooth and rounded enough to drink neat. Aftertaste goes on forever, some peat, rich mouthfeel, complex nose with orange peel/ almonds/ coconut/ peat and plenty more.Shame it's only 50cl.Packageing is quite special - a great present. Scotch connoiseurs might not enjoy because it isnt an immitator. But if you have an open mind, this will be a firm favourite and worth tracking down."
"885","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Beautiful","It's really beautiful whisky .. but only what i want to know is how many years is matured ? or this information is unknown ? can somebody help me with it ? "
"886","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Amazing whisky","I just tried this last night thanks to a friend having a bottle.This is an exquisite whisky.Amazing nose, I could sit sniffing it in for hours!Very good and rich palate!I must get one for myself soon!"
"887","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","A good birthday present","This whiskey was bought for me as a present and I found it to be very pleasant but stronger than my usual scotch. It was better than I expected; I wouldn't have had the Japanese down as accomplished whiskey makers. I would buy it again and would recommend it."
"888","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel","Nikka","Value for money","What value! I know it's only a 50cl bottle, but still, touch of peat too. Great stuff..."
"889","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Nice","Sweet, thick and lasting vanilla taste. Love it. "
"890","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Wow","A truly unique whisky. You'll think ""Coffey"" is a misspelling, because it kind of tastes like a Frappuccino. I know that may not be the most educated way of describing a whiskey, but seriously, that's what it tastes like.Know anyone who says they don't like whisky? Drop an ice cube into a finger or two of this and watch their eyes open. This is the smoothest whisky I've ever had in my life. And 90 proof with no heat! How did they do it?"
"891","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Great service","The best service ever, very, very polite helpful staff, amazing service and I am told amazing product, will definitely recommend this company"
"892","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Very impressed ","Very impressed with this whisky. I am a 12yo Redbrest man but this certainly give it a run. Can't find it in Dublin which is a pity..."
"893","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Smooth, sweet, round","I bought a bottle of this at a Whisky tasting event. I had never tried Japanese Whisky before and was on a mission! I was surprise by this one - normally I prefer malts but this grain whisky is smooth and round, slightly sweet vanilla-like and a long lasting pleasant aftertaste. Love it."
"894","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Excellent. ","Ignore the previous review. As a Scotsman with a large selection of malts in my cabinet I can honestly say this is the nicest whisky I have ever had. "
"895","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Rip-off","It tastes about the same like american grain whiskey. Only costs twice as much."
"896","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","One to keep on hand ","Deep and rich nose packed with stone fruits, berries, caramel, and vanilla. Definitely sweet but a presence of grass and soil is noticeable. The taste is delicate, refined, and complex, but the real star of this whisky is the finish! Expect a flavor bomb of vanilla and oak that lasts and lasts like it was shot out of a cannon. It just keeps going. A real hidden gem of a whisky. "
"897","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","A sure thing - very tasty.","Very nice, mellow whisky.  Definitely toward a bourbon with hints of vanilla and caramel.  It's a great one to introduce to whisky novices.  I'm not sure how it compares to  Nikka from the barrel - alas they don't ship that one to the states.    "
"898","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Overall great","Smells hard core, goes in full of flavor, goes down smooth, aside from the hard liquor small, overall great."
"899","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Caramelized sugars & butter on toast","Smell like a brandy, spicy, white grape, apple, brown sugar, burnt sugar, caramel, hints of maple syrup, buttery, decadent, sugar sweet, cologne, toasted wheat bread.  To me this whiskey amounts to sweet caramelized sugars and butter smeared on some toasted wheat bread. Very tasty, my only complaints are the price ($59.99 700ml) and NAS."
"900","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Cambridge Whisky Nut says:","One of the most unusual and intriguing whiskies out there... But oh so good! It was a favorite at a recent tasting I hosted. Beginners and connoisseurs alike loved the harmony of the smells and flavours of this. The tasting notes from the chaps on this site are spot on to give you a good idea. Fantastic buy!"
"901","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Impressive","The Japanese whiskies I had tasted never satisfied me (i.e. Hibiki 18, Miyagikyo 10). But I was really impressed by this one. It's a bit like the King Car Conductor but less overpowering sweetness, bourbon influences but more herbal and with a Fino-feeling/taste to it. I usually drink sherrybombs but this one may become a standard bottle in my collection."
"902","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Like a very good bourbon","I bought a sample of this after trying Compass Box Hedonism and being impressed, as I'd never tried grain whisky before. It's nothing like Hedonism, but is very delicious, like a fine bourbon with hints of vanilla and toffee. I prefer this to Nikka From The Barrel, which is also very good, but this seems much smoother. Highly recommended."
"903","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Really enjoyed it...","Had this at a small bar in San Francisco last business trip. Really enjoyed it. I'm new to whisk(e)y and previously enjoyed bourbons much more. This reminds me of a nice mellow, very smooth bourbon. I drink mine with a nice whisky ice cube that slowly melts and as it adds a little water to the whisky, it really opens up. Definitely one of my smoother drinking Japanese whisky experiences. Price is also quite reasonable with good availability for a Japanese whisky."
"904","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Surprisingly good","I tasted this one this Christmas and I love it. It did three things to me, the same things that a good single malt, a 20 year old port and a smooth cognac do, but all at once ... dark, light and then thick with a memory sweet, all rolled into one?Mind you I usually drink the highland stuff and peated to the core, this isn't that, but this is rather good."
"905","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Bourbon","I think it's up there with some of the better bourbons.  That said, good bourbon can be had for $40 at cask strength, so the price is pretty high.  Is there some rye or something else in here?  Maybe, not sure; it's been a while since I've had a bourbon to compare against.  Still, an interesting novelty."
"906","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Just tried this","Gorgeous!!"
"907","Nikka Coffey Grain Whisky","Nikka","Coffey Grain *and* Coffey Malt","More cousins than sisters - Both the Coffey Grain and the Coffey Malt are wonderful. The real opportunity for an aficionado is to have both bottles. You can have a great celebration simply tasting both in the same evening. I always bring both bottles to the table when we have company! "
"908","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel Gift Pack","Nikka","A perfect example of a flavourful oriental malt whisky.","As a frequent visitor to Japan I often enjoy oriental whisky, and this is a fine example. I can highly recommend the smooth, warming nature of this whisky, especially on cold nights. The gift pack is especially well done, very tasteful."
"909","Nikka Whisky From The Barrel Gift Pack","Nikka","Nikka whiskey gift pack","Just received the nikka whiskey gift pack!! Fantastic packaging and a great product, delivered bang on time. The small glasses are very cute! Will be recommending master of malt to friends and family and will certainly be using again!!Matthew"
"910","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Smooth.","I paid a little more than most for my bottle simply because I live in an expensive area just outside of Washington DC. As a First time buyer when I first cracked it open I gave it a whiff and it had a lovely Aroma of fruits and smoke. I then anticipatingly pour a shot into my favorite glass, and as I always do, I gulped it down in one swift motion letting it slide down my tongue and the back of my throat. It went down ultra-smooth leaving an after Aroma in my nose that was both gentle and enjoyable. Sort of like taking a cup of warm coffee and slurping it down. I will buy this again however I will try and find a cheaper location. A bit too pricey at $71 a bottle. I've seen it for $10 less online. I can only hope that I can find it that cheap locally in the store. All in all for any liquor under $100 a bottle this stuff definitely hits the spot. If you want to sit down and have a few stiff shots but don't like your throat to burn like somebody poured lit lighter fluid down your throat, this is the whiskey for you. Two words: VERY Smooth..."
"911","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","So delicately balanced","Wow, big green apple on nose. Drink straight: Scotchy for sure with Japanese balance made light & smooth. Sweet & bitter grass with the lightest of smoke for me. Finishes like wine IMO. "
"912","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Worth a try!","Costco had a few bottles so i picked one up. Very enjoyable blend. After my first sip I wasn't sold but after letting it get some air it really grew on me. Very easy to drink and carries an excellent range of flavors. For $50 I was very happy with the purchase! "
"913","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","A very approachable and easy drinking, smooth whiskey with just enough character","Pay no attention to the negative comments that some have left. This is Japanese whiskey (JW), not scotch. Yes, similar but not scotch. I think most negative reviewers had some preconceived expectation that was not met. I tried this without knowing what to expect--I think it was better that way! Anyway, give this a try if you are getting into JW. You won't be disappointed at all! I'm very glad I chose this one! When I first opened it, it had slight smokiness which faded after getting some oxygen. It has a pleasantly smooth character with just enough flavor and complexity to make it enjoyable. This will be a staple in the spirits cabinet for years to come. I've also let several different whiskey drinkers (including 2 very seasoned bourbon guys) try this, and they all agreed it was very good and worth trying! I'm looking forward to trying the other Nikka offerings sooner than later!  "
"914","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","The Go-To Underestimated Japanese Whiskey","Exceptionally smooth. One of the smoothest whiskeys I've had. I had seen a special on Japanese whiskey's recently and felt the urge to pick one out. Did a little reading, but feel lucky to have chosen the Nikka Taketsuru. A few reviewers below have beaten this up for lack of smokiness. Wrong scotch for that. Or too heavy? Did not feel that. This is an easy well---balanced scotch to have if you keep 2-3 on the shelf. "
"915","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","A great morning whisky. ","An exceptional blend, very drinkable and affordable. The nose is bees wax, raisins with a light vanilla charcoal smoke in the back. Opens with warm spiced citrus and a short smokey pepper finish."
"916","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Great Japanese whiskey","Very nice Japanese whiskey, enough complexity but still pretty smooth"
"917","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Taste is not good, heavy, not smoo","Its not smooth, not nice, but heavy taste. Even with ice cubes. I Will not recommend. "
"918","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Doesn't stand out","I looked forward to trying this from some of the reviews I'd read, but ultimately thought it neither stood out nor offered anything unique when compared with a variety of other whiskeys at a similar price point. Flavor was fine, but underdeveloped. Simply put, it's unmemorable. At the current $60 price point, there are a number of far more enjoyable options to buy."
"919","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Very nice entry in to Japanese Nikka ","Very nice pepper, but sweet beautiful colour "
"920","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Great Japanese whiskey","This is a great whiskey. It is well put together and the flavors are complex. "
"921","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","I highly recommend it. ","A very nice whisky, a classic example of Japanese craftsmanship. The Scottish origins are evident, and is capable of standing alongside many a scotch. This has a touch of smoke, is sweet with a bit o fruit, vanilla and a touch of nuts. This is well balanced and I will keep it in my cabinet as part of my collection. Makes for a nice, reasonably priced daily drinker. I doubt I will ever tire of it. "
"922","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Nice","Although not an expert, I find this whisky one of the best tasting experiences I ever had. True to the above description 100%. I would definitely suggest it."
"923","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","JW Black","This is just JW Black, at double the price.  I can't say I've tasted them side-by-side, but I've had JW Black and JW Blue ... and this is no JW Blue.  (And even JW Blue was just okay).  I haven't tried any of the other JW expressions, but seriously there's no need to.  This thing is right at the Black level, just double the price."
"924","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Good for its value ","Seems pretty close to a Yamazaki 12 to me although more fruit on the palate. Not bad but I agree drinking too much could lead to some heart burn. A Whiskey to enjoy 1 glass per session."
"925","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","How is this so well reviewed?","This was really rough.. I decided to buy a bottle and line it up against previous age statements in a blind tasting... well it wasn't blind for long.. immediately on the nose you could tell this had spirits under 3 years old in the glass.My biggest gripe here is it tastes nothing like the previous Taketsuru bottlings.. there is no smokiness and it reminds me more of an american rye than something that belongs along side quality scotch... the aged is extremely balanced and one of my all time favorites, the NAS leaves me feeling I spent way too much... for young inexperienced whisky. There's nothing wrong with young american rye (not my favorite, but there's nothing wrong with it), but they should bottle this spirit under a different name ...Normally, I steer clear of NAS, I don't buy into any reasoning except that they're trying to hide young whisky because of supplies... and it's not like they're heavily discounted versus aged versions, they still want the same amount of cash in many cases. I made an exception here because of my love for Taketsuru and my dwindling (1/5th of my last bottle remaining) supply.Oh well....Oh and to the comment about the price in Japan.. that's how it is with almost all Japanese whisky... if you go to Japan you will buy it for a fantastic price... but outside Japan you pay the markup.. it leads me to avoid most Japanese whisky, it's good... but that international markup drives it outside of a respectable price point. I think my Hibiki 18 was something like $40 when I was there last a couple years ago."
"926","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Uninspiring ","On it's one with nothing to compare this is likely a good whiskey but over the course of a night of tasting this some out as status quo...uninspiring...albeit solid. Not overpowering on the aroma, spicy but flat lines. One taster said ""This is the white paint of whiskey. No depth to the flavour."" Another taster gets the ""acid reflux"" sensation which some might consider a long finish."
"927","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt (70cl, 43.0%)","En väldigt djup, mörk och mastig doft av frukt samt lite lätt sherry som övergår till citron mot slutet. Om jag inte visste hur mycket alkohol det var i denna så skulle jag gissat på cask strength på grund av de djupa dofterna. Smaken är främst fruktig och maltig men man tycks hitta en gnutta havssalt samt sherry också. Man känner att den inte är lika stark som den tycks lukta, tyvärr något spritig.Doften är så speciell att jag skulle vilja ge 5/5 genom att bara lukta på den men efter att ha smakat den är jag något besviken. Hur som helst efter att ha haft ett par droppar vatten i den så är det en ganska god whisky i alla fall som får ett helhetsbetyg på 3,5/5 med tanke på det något för höga priset."
"928","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","20€ at supermarket, Japan","The price at europe seems to be way off. Seems like someone is taking a big cut :)"
"929","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Great whisky","Spot on with the tasting notes, this is a rather splendid and very drinkable dram. I am impressed with this blended malt and highly recommend. "
"930","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Brilliant","I tried this at a whiskey bar in Bethlehem, Pa over the weekend. It was so spectacular that I bought a bottle immediately on the following Monday. I am primarily a Islay man - Uigeadail  and Lagavulin 16 are my mainstays. Off the island I am a fan of Glenmorangie - really enjoy the expressions [10, Lasanta and Quinta Rubin] I have tried.That said - I have never really found a blended malt that I truly enjoyed. Until Now!The Taketsuru is in a class by itself when it comes to blends and it holds it own against almost all the Single Malts I have tried.And I will say this - the tasting notes above are some of the most accurate I have seen. I can honestly say everything mention comes across the nose and the palate.Put this in regular rotation and you will not be disappointed."
"931","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Last Minute catch","I just drove by the local Nikka factory near Sendai, Japan. The factory closes at 4:30 PM and I got there at 4:26 PM. The taketsuru was on sale for about 3000 Yen and I had to get the bottle quickly to the register and out of the shop. Believe me, this was one of the best last minute deals I have ever landed!"
"932","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","A personal favourite","I enjoy the range of Scotches, from sweet and citrusy to pungent and peaty. That said, this relatively inexpensive,  delicate and  floral whisky is so far my favourite of them all, including quite a few at 3-4 times the cost (and not excluding some other Japanese products). I appreciate the subtlety, the complexity, the many layers and the long finish. A superb product. I can't recommend it enough. There are over 50 bottles in my Scotch cabinet. This one is always at the very front. "
"933","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","The best ive tried.","One of the best whisky ive tried."
"934","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Great","Smooth, delicious, and a little bit smoky tail. Mmmm very good. Beginning taste reminds me very Yamazaki 12 but end is different. But I prefer and will buy Yamazaki 12 ."
"935","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Evolves in your mouth","Have to agree with the other comments on this page: MoM have nailed the tasting notes here. I certainly got the honey'd cereals and apple tones on the nose, which for me, then very steadily developed into dark chocolate / coffee beans. Then the smoke rises and fills your mouth like vapour. Wow. Just wow.I am becoming more of a mega-fan of Japanese whisky by the day. Nikka and Suntory are producing some spellbinding malts, and this is is one of those Japanese expressions that is leading the charge."
"936","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Hats off to the Chaps","I've been a fan of Master of Malts for many years but your description of this particular malt could not be more accurate.  Thank you for everything you do,  your work doesn't go unappreciated.  Sincerely, Canada; )"
"937","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","My go to ""scotch"" whiskey... John Rain would LOVE this... Perhaps even Reacher..","I discovered this rare, subtle, warrior whiskey on the top shelf of a local diner in Oakland CA on a quiet early Sunday morning in late August 2015 ... it was my birthday and I was launching into the third day of my weekend worth of celebrations and I spied a bottle of brown liquor with Japanese characters on the label ... next to the Macallan 18 yr old.. I was listening to a John Rain novel on my headset. So I chose the Japanese spirit.. OMG.. I am so glad I did. Macallan who?? what?? Yeah.. it's like that... My friends who don't even like whiskey LOVE this gem ... I'm going to order a case, cause now, just like Oakland used to be the best kept secret in the Bay Area, the word is out. I'm not even going to describe how awesome this spirit tastes because I'll just add to the noise on the bandwagon... Just gonna get my case and try not to consume the entire dozen before my next birthday in late August... :-) "
"938","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Simpson of Tulsa","Wow!!  I am a Scotch purist for the most part.  Love 15 year old Balvenie Sherry cask matured as well as Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban and Balvenie 21 Port Wood!  I have to admit with a tucked tail, that this is an amazing bottle.  Nice soft bite before an almost over ripe pear blast of flavor.  This is followed by a wonderful fall of figs and barely ripe bing cherries.  Must have some Olorosso Sherry casks involved.  I could be wrong, but that is the taste I get.  Don't look over this beautifull (I misspelled beautiful because it deserves more than one l(ove)) spirit.  I can't call it a scotch, but to think of it as less than the spirit of the gods doesn't give it it's due."
"939","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Nikka","It tastes very deep and almost like a cask strength, love it!The taste isn't really what I expected though and you may need a few drips of water in it."
"940","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Silken smooth","Today I tasted and it is damn good and silken smooth  with heavenly taste. I am fan of Japanese pure malt and will be trying more Jap single malts"
"941","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Very smooth","I just got my bottle today and I have to say it's a really good whiskey. It has a very nice kick to it too aside from being real smooth. It almost reminds me of a mix between a whiskey and a japanese plum wine. If your not a fan of japanese whiskey you should at least try this one because it's very good in its own way."
"942","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Very Outstanding","Smoky flavor, an image of an old man appears.Strong flavor, not like usual blended whiskey, very outstanding.Very close to single malt."
"943","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","taketsuru pure malt. ","outstanding"
"944","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Top Marks","Outstanding whisky,this is my bottle of choice.Nothing else comes close."
"945","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Put this in your pipe ","For any doubters of Japanese Whisky...I dare you to try a bottle of this and write a bad review! This is my go to blend and has been for several years. You simply cannot find a better dram for the price. Soft, smoky, fruity sweet and you crave more. Long distinguished finish. Beautiful. "
"946","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","My top contender ","Had quite a few bottle of that delicious whisky. Can't recommend it enough. I keep finding myself coming back to that one. Its smooth, complex, with a long finish. Definitely my favorite scotch in that range of price."
"947","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Wow","I just bought a bottle of this surprisingly complex and outstanding Japanese whisky. I read about the quality of Japanese whisky but I was surprised how smooth and complex this whisky is. I plan to buy a case tomorrow. Enjoy!"
"948","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Impressive","I could say lots of great things about this whisky. Trust me, get it and you will buy it over again and again. This is coming from a scotch enthusiast. Japanese craftsmanship at its best. Now my everyday dram."
"949","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Now a believer!","I was one of the ""Japanese can't make great whisky guy"". Boy was I wrong. This thing is young and smooth but at the same time it has amazing complexity and a finale that seems to linger forever. Now I crave it! Simply amazing. Now I have to get my hands on the Miyagikyo!"
"950","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Impressed","I am a fan of hakushu whiskies & have been totally against non age statements. I bought this by mistake thinking it was a 12 year old nikka taketsuru as labeled on the shelf. I decided to give it a try since I have already bought it. I must say I am pleasantly surprised by how smooth & full bodied this tasted. It taste like a toned down hakushu 12. I am glad I have a few more bottles to enjoy. "
"951","Nikka Taketsuru Pure Malt","Nikka","Can't be this one","I am a bartender by trading, tried over 200 different scotches/ whiskies, this one blows them all away.  very complete taste full body, smooth, and enjoyable to drink, just pick up a case of 6, will probably need to order more as they go fast, don't hold back on this one folks, ENJOY THE JAPANESE STYLES"
"952","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Brilliant","Uber smooth. A cross between a single malt and a bourbon. Notes of chocolate, caramel, and espresso. Seems like the issue with the Nikka NAS single malts that replaced the age statements is so many people loved the age statements and have not compared 10/12/15/20 yr olds to NAS in blind tastings, seeing how many people like the coffey malt, coffey grain, and nikka from the barrel. "
"953","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","I always have one in my bar","A fantastic late evening whisky. One of my favourites "
"954","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","deludente","male ..molto male...deludente,dolciastro,ricorda il bourbon,molto ma molto caro per quello che vale"
"955","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","I am seriously impressed....","One of the smoothest...wonderfully creamy across the palate."
"956","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Maybe it's me, but I've never tasted anything like it.","Wonderfully smooth. My new favorite."
"957","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Great whisky","Hard to find here but worth the effort ."
"958","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Great japanese whisky","I absolutely love this whisky. Everytime i pour a dram it's a new emotion. Seriously this is great"
"959","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","I loved it","A friend brought some over for Christmas dinner and I fell in love! It's a little sweet but not in a bad way.  Great smooth flavor"
"960","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Not great","This stuff isn't horrible but it isn't what I would call great"
"961","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Goes well with Helen Merrill with Clifford Brown","It reminds you of some coffee liqueur you made your date lovelier, but it tastes far more refined. I usually go for Islay single malt, but this one moved me into a different direction, or, destination. But the ultimate destination stays the same: Helen Merrill with Clifford Brown. A fabulous whiskey, a fabulous night of music. "
"962","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Wonderful","The biggest problem with this whisky is running out of it. Fabulous stuff"
"963","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Meh","Not unpleasant but not particularly exciting. No stand out flavours. Enyoyed the glass I tried would drink it again if it was going bit wouldn't pay for it. Too much taste of raw alcohol aswel....meh"
"964","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Very disapointed","No complexity, no flavor, to much taste of alcool, nothing stay in mouth, very disapointed for the price it costs. I advise you a NiKKA black much much better, my favorit one"
"965","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","One of the best nosing whiskies!","A very well rounded whisky with notes of raisins, apricot, vanilla and toffee, yet without the lingering taste of honey.  Extremely smooth, with an oily viscous texture that coats the mouth.  Hard to come by in my region, but certainly worth the wait."
"966","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Wtf","The smokeiness was okay, but the overall flavor was way off. Barf! Also, burping afterwards is the worse part."
"967","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Sweet with a lovely finish","I tasted this tonight for the first time.  The first taste was sweet, honey-like, but not at all cloying.  Notes of vanilla, toffee flavors.  I sipped it neat and enjoyed it totally.  It does not have the bite of a bourbon, rather a smooth finish more like a sweet Scotch.  I can drink this regularly with pleasure."
"968","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","OK, not more","First of all - it is not single malt. It reminds me bourbon,as Four Roses (Single barrel), but it is more subtle. Sweet vanilla, corn.As for me it is ok to drink with some meal (meat) not as digestive.Alex."
"969","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","A surprise in a bottle","I was drinking this strait for a bit when the flavor started to fall off. I started adding a cube of ice to cool it down and add some water and the flavor opened up and all the subtle flavors came out. I recommend this as an introduction to Japanese Whiskeys. I would definitely get this one again!"
"970","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Great Whiskey!","Really surprised by the taste- strong toffee flavor- smooth, slightly viscous.  "
"971","Nikka Coffey Malt Whisky","Nikka","Who needs words?","Mmmmmmmmmmmm!"
"972","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Lovely stuff ","I've had nikka before in a few different guises. From the barrel, coffey etc. But this really is a hugely enjoyable experience. Lovely finish. Would definitely recommend. "
"973","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","perfect sunny afternoon dram with a cigar.","Leave it to the Japanese to take something that was perfect, and make it better!"
"974","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Black attack!","Very Nice!👍😎"
"975","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Most excellent!","Something I want more. Soft, rich and sophisticated."
"976","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Еxcellent","Absolutely unique taste . Highly recommended"
"977","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Trying it for the first time","Let's see..!"
"978","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","nikka pure malt black whiskey","absolute perfect for my palate"
"979","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Loved this...","Finished a wonderful meal (asparagus, chateaubriand steak) at our local gastropub with this whisky and a coffee.  I've had Suntory whiskies before but never a Nikka. It is smooth, well-flavoured, complex on the palate.  I'd recommend this - agree it reminded me of Penderyn in a good way."
"980","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Andy Just","Simple, bit smokey, bit dark chocolate, coffee, all mixed up in a wonderful taste. Definitely top quality at this pricing level."
"981","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","i'm a beginner and even i ......","This is a wonderful whisky! fruit,peat spice, and hints of coffee and dark chocolate open up when swallowed. oily and coats your tongue. i feel like a VIP when i drink this stuff, damn the Japs, this is top quality!"
"982","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Nothing special, but...","I love this one. Seems to be simple at the first sip to open up with every next. Too complex or me (positively) to name all the tastes and smells I can feel (I blame the lack of proper tasting training). In short: amazing for a blend. Or rather the perfect example that blends can be great, too. 8/10 for me. "
"983","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","yum","Delicious, interesting and smooth. There's interesting tastes of bertie basset based treat's, a little saline. Well done Nikka. "
"984","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","a gem","OutstandingHave some, watch your tongue smile after the first sipKeep in your mouth for a good few seconds, then swallowIt will slowly jab your taste buds..Love it... Steve Mcgiff Cornwall..."
"985","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Mr Lewis","Received a bottle as a gift a very nice surprise unknown to myself this whisky was thinner than the malts i usually drink but has  a wonderful flavour with a strong kick very much like penderyn whiskey."
"986","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Disappointed","Like someone has matured the spirit with sticking plasters!"
"987","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","stunning....","I am drinking this right now.The nose is truly beautifulBags of glamourI just cannot stop sniffing itThe taste is immaculateTue obsession with Japanese whiskey is in full flowEvery whiskey I have purchased from Japan is unique and carries bags of intelligence.Recommend this thoroughly...."
"988","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Wow....Excellent","If you like very well balanced with all obvious elements of smoke, peat, fruit, wood and sweet all working together perfectly then this is a beast.  I could sniff this all day & sip this all night.  It has an addictive nose (yes i do go to the cupboard and pull the cork sniff and put the cork back on many times with this one), beautiful taste and great long fade finish......I don't know what else can be asked for in a whisky?.........well 70cl instead of 50cl maybe!"
"989","Nikka Pure Malt Black","Nikka","Great","This really is a wonderfully balanced blend, well worth a purchase.  Fantastic flavours and a pleasure to drink."
"990","The Nikka 12 Year Old","Nikka","Simply amazing!","Full bodied, pleasant oak, rich, fruity (Apple),  cream, vanilla and caramel with a touch of peat which gives it a salty/savory flavor.  Flavor profile is quite similar to Highland Park 12 but richer in flavor and taste. Amazing for a blended whisky to be as rich and flavorful as a single malt Scotch. Easily blows away any blended scotch at 12 years old. Its even way better than Dewars 15 which is watery, spirity and lacks flavor and complexity. Had this for less than 5000 yen and absolutely worth it for that price. Too bad this whisky is overpriced outside of Japan."
"991","The Nikka 12 Year Old","Nikka","A great blend","It’s a well rounded blend. Smooth, tasty and very drinkable. Would not buy again but once was definitely worth it. "
"992","The Nikka 12 Year Old","Nikka","Oh no! Not another great Japanese whisky!","Really!? What are they up to? I don't drink blended whisky (occasional exception for the Chivas Regal 18 yr old). Oscar (great guy, runs my favourite liquor store, insists on sharing his ""enthusiasm"" even at 10 a.m.) twisted my arm with a free sample. Bought a bottle straight off. There's a big dash of Yoichi in here so there is a nice, warming hint of peat. Not so much peat that it blots out the delightful tropical fruit though. Toasty, oaky, warm and creamy, butterscotch toffee and smooooooooooth. Honestly, if you didn't know, you'd never guess it was a blended whisky. This is a new permanent fixture in my collection."
"993","The Nikka 12 Year Old","Nikka","Advent calendar day 1","Big Japanese whisky fan & this fits the mound. Tinges of apple on the nose, but forgetting the pomp, this tastes amazing. Great stuff, shall be getting a bottle."
"994","Nikka Coffey Gin","Nikka","This is an exceptional gin. It is something you have to try and something that will stun you once you do. It is unlike anything else. Goes very well with a slightly sweeter tonic and a wedge of lime or rapsberry.  DIVINE! ","Beautiful and floral, citrusy and woody, gentle yet serious 5/5"
"995","Nikka Coffey Gin","Nikka","Exceptional","This is an incredible gin. The smell! You can sip this with ice & nothing else. Citrusy, a little different, simply divine"
"996","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Something to share with best friends. Amazing stuff and subtle.","When I poured the first glass, the nose was like a typical Highland whiskey, a bit of peat but also very strong ""I have a lot of single malt"" statement. First sips and I was sure I am drinking some of non-Speyside Highlander. The balance of this whiskey is one of the finest among blends, as usual, Japanese have to bring everything to the new level. A bit pricey but I happily forgot about it after the first three sips. For some reason it has mixed reviews on various forums and websites. But I am giving it 5 stars, amazing blend."
"997","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Better than you think ...","I didn't expect much an grab it in the last minute in the Warsaw duty free shop. I found out that its very good blended whisky. Balance, elegant and full of flavours. "
"998","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Exceptional value","Perhaps the best value in blended whiskies in the market now. So smooth, not too sweet, no alcohol whiff. Haven't tasted a blended this nice since the old Ballantine's 17 -- at half the price!"
"999","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","A treat","Try it with a little ice, it really opens up the flavour. Beautiful whisky in every sense of the word."
"1000","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","my new ballantines 17","Perhaps the best value blend out there at the moment and a great replacement for the Ballantines 17 which now offers poor value since the reduction to 40%. Missing the subtle smoke of the Ballantines, but makes up for it in other ways. deliciously sweet, clean and moreish, shows off Nikka's complete command of blending. Far better than Suntory's entry level distillers reserve products, especially the overpriced hibiki harmony, and nearly as good as Nikka's own coffey grain/malt for 2/3rds the price! "
"1001","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","I lied!","I wrote the 3 star review right after opening, but I have to say, oxidization has really helped this whisky. Tastes like the Green label, but smells much better, like honey cake/custard."
"1002","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Average","Very smooth on the palate, but seriously lacks depth. Like the Green label, but less depth, not as sweet, not as harsh (feels diluted). Nose is initially fairly boring, after a while begins to smell like custard."
"1003","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","What a treat!","The flavour is so subtle. And after some time it smells like milk!"
"1004","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Nikka blended whisky","Nikka blended. Extreme value for money!!! Smooth and notes of chocolate and coffee"
"1005","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Smooth","Just outstanding. "
"1006","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Value for money","Balanced and elegant"
"1007","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Great","Bought this from vienna airport. Intersting shop, you could taste what you're buying. This was Intersting."
"1008","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","Great Surprise","  I didn´t expect a great blended whisky. Wrong!. It´s a very good blended whisky. Elegant, full of flavour. "
"1009","Nikka Blended Whisky","Nikka","LazzaB","My daughter bought me a bottle for Christmas; sublime."
"1010","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Smoky with a sweet finish, pairs good with a mild cigar","Very good entry into Japanese whisky. Smooth, smoky with a sweet finish pairs good with a mild flavoured cigar, the smoky start and the smoke from the cigar cancel each other out and they bring all the notes from both to life."
"1011","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","King of the Blends? ","I'm finding it difficult to find a better blended whiskey than the All Malt. Tis a worthy whiskey and for the price it packs a wallop. Very taste, easy on the taste buds and smooth as. "
"1012","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Hard to beat for this price - Incredible whiskey, Beautiful stuff!","Amazing whiskey, massive flavour and punch, what a beauty!"
"1013","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Decreased quality. ","A clear decrease in quality compared with earlier bottles I've had a few years ago. Too young, spirity, burnt on the nose. The taste is perhaps a little bit better, but way behind other malt whisky's in this price range. Will not buy again. "
"1014","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Inital smoke, velvety finish, very good price","I am and always have been a fan of Islay malts and had chance upon this bottle as i took upon myself to understand the fuss on Japanese blends. It blew my mind away."
"1015","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Smooth like silk flows like pure nectar ","Fabulous whiskey value for money "
"1016","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","A great entry point whisky","If you're look for an entry into Japanese whisky, this and 'Nikka Blended Whisky' are excellent value entry points that are affordable and worth every penny to the last drop. Start your journey with these two and I'm confident the palette will be appetising for more of what Japan has to offer. They know their stuff, offer something unique, refined and a want for more."
"1017","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Smooth n superb ","Fabulous whiskey Manoj Ramchandani "
"1018","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Very Good!","A very good japanese malt. Smooth ,but well rounded.Light hint of smoke as well. Need few drops of water to open up.Really worth for the price. I enjoyed alot."

"1020","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","I really enjoyed it, smooth and absolutley stunning.","and for the price... !W!O!W!"
"1021","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Worth every penny","very good"
"1022","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Makes Scotch look like it´s gone bad.","Takes the blend whiskes to a higher level. Smooth and very tasty. When you put feeling into it, this is the result.very very good Japan.I thought it imossible to rate a blend higher than 7, but ......."
"1023","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Undermatured single malt","Tastes like no age cheap blended"
"1024","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Light but not without depth","A lovely surprise. I'm a recent convert to Japanese single malts, and this blend is really quite special. Smooth, light, but complex too - many tastes cross the palate - nuts, light fruit, wood, with a wonderful, almost lotus flower fragrance. Tastes bring to mind a Japanese tea garden after the rain. At this price too it's impossible not to buy, and try"
"1025","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Well Rounded Dram","A very well presented malt blend at a great price. Just what effect the unique 'Coffey Still' malt distillation process has is unclear but the end result is a very well-rounded dram with plenty of complexity and good flavour. I would love to taste it at 48% ABV but you can't have everything.   "
"1026","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Too cheap","This is an absolute bargain. It is a very well rounded sweet, smooth and tasty little number. Very easy to drink and at this price it can easily be overlooked. Dont hesitate to buy this. Its just so easy to drink. Very enjoyable,"
"1027","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Ooops... forgot my rating","Yep, again forgot to click the stars...... review above."
"1028","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","The price is a joke.... The bottle might be awful.....","But seriously - who buys whiskey and just looks at it?!!At nearly £20 cheaper than Hibiki and Yamazaki 12yo this is a serious, serious whiskey of all time contender. I very nearly didn't buy this because of the bottle and assuming it would be nowhere near as nice as the two other Japanese whiskeys named above. The cellar man assured me this needed to be tried. A sample was had, then another just for good measure... and decision made... Really Really close to being as nice as the other Japanese whiskeys. In my Whiskey Awards... approx. £30 a bottle range. The winners are this Green Spot and Balvenie. Jason Breen"
"1029","Nikka All Malt","Nikka","Malt Mates' Delight","Has the usual bourbony sweetness with some banana!  Yeah.  Brown sugar and cinnamon on the nose. More luxurious and full than the ABV would lead one to expect.In the mouth the All Malt cuts loose brown sugar, cactus nectar, cacao, barley of course, cashews, and last but not least, SHERRY.Cactus nectar, cask wood, dark chocolate, and maple tree sap (not syrup).  All told, this dram will float your boat.  It's sea worthy."
"1030","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Not a value for money option","Very good balanced palate, spicy enough and long smooth and dry finish. Easy to drink and a good drum. There are much more value for money alternatives though. "
"1031","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Perfection","A truly unique whiskey, tastes absolutely beautiful, the complex flavour long lasting in the mouth very rounded completely magnificent,  a drink not to be hurried only to be fully enjoyed by oneself (friends drink it too fast)Truly one of mankind's perfect gifts. "
"1032","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka"," Complex with a  Unique  taste  that develops as it sits on the pallet ","Insane good!!"
"1033","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Amazing","One of the best, can't wait for the 21 Year Old ;)"
"1034","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Anything you can do, we can do better........","I am really struggling to think of a Scotch malt whisky that balances the sherried elements with the smoky as pleasingly as this does. Admittedly 17 yrs is very old by Japanese standards but even 30 year old Islays that I've tasted are either too heavy on phenol (Bowmore, Ardbeg, Laphroig...) or too light on smoke (Bunnahabhain). I've had a few mildly smokey Bunnas but to reach this level of complexity and smoothness, they have to be very old (39 yrs Cadenheads single cask) and therefore very expensive. Ditto the Scappas and HPs. Bruichladdich pulled it off with the Black Arts 4.1, though that was very light on the smoke. Older Arrans can be very good but sherried expressions are very rare.Hats off to Nikka therefore for a perfectly balanced (imo) rich, mildly smokey, slightly floral, honeyish, chocolatey malt. Shame it's so darned expensive here in Europe but I'll surely be stocking up on this one."
"1035","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","fantastic!","OMG, i can't believe how delicious this whisky is. the slight kick at the end was a surprise as i expected it to be smoother  but then again, it went so well that the little kick at the end just made it seem exotic. i need to stock up on this."
"1036","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Acetone","My bottle had a face and mouth full of acetone. Adding some water helped this, but then the fact that it was too long in the wood really shone through. The wisps of smoke were nice, though. But at best there is a consistency issue with this whisky."
"1037","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Better than hibiki 17","My favorite Japanese whisky. Toffee chocolate flavor, long smooth finish. "
"1038","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","One of the best ","Friend brought his back from Japan for me. Simply one of the best I have ever had"
"1039","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","delicious","omg, a little ouch of kick than I did not expect but in a good way (like an active senior person) ohhh the light woody aroma with dark fruits, toffee, coffee and peat, absolutely bloody delicious. the Japanese sure know how to make delicious whisky. Too bad the damn price for Japanese whisky has gone up so much. "
"1040","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old (70cl, 43.0%)","Fantastic"
"1041","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Terrific","very nice aroma with hint of oak wood. fantastic!"
"1042","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Fantastic","Got my bottle at Narita airport last year for aprox 3500 yen which is a complete bargain for this one. Everything with this Whisky is very characteristic for Nikka in general. Hints of coffee, toffee, oak and the subtle pettiness would be a quick summary. This whisky is a mix of whiskies from their two distilleries Miyagikyo and Yoichi, which you understand if you have tried the single malts separately. Miyagikyo is the more elegant and smooth one while Yoichi is powerful and a bit peaty. The price defined at the website is a bit high in my opinion, but if you are in Japan you can usually get it for under 6000 yen which is a great price for a whisky like this."
"1043","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Great if you can find it","Picked up a bottle when passing through Narita a couple of weeks ago en route to the States from SE Asia. A mind-blowing 3500 yen (only £19) for a Taketsuru 17? I didn't even hesitate. My plan was to pack that one carefully in my checked bag and buy another bottle on the return trip a week and a half later, when I would be staying in Tokyo for a few days. Sadly, it had long since sold out throughout the airport by that time. With the help of some gracious locals, I was able to track down a small shop which had just gotten a fresh shipment in the previous day, and though they didn't carry the 17, they did have a few of the great Taketsuru 21s in stock for only 6000 yen (£32), so naturally, I snagged one of those.As for the 17, well, it won WWA's World's Best Blended Malt award in 2015, a very good sign, but of course whisky tasting is always going to be subjective. I personally like this one quite a lot... fragrant, spicy, warm, complex, a bit sharp on the finish, but that's easily moderated by toning down the alcohol with a splash of water. (Even though this is a pretty standard 43% ABV, the alcohol seems to stand out, particularly towards the end. I certainly don't think it overwhelms the dram, but it's slightly more pronounced than I might have expected.) This one doesn't have the subtle sweetness nor the sherry influence I picked up in the 21, so it's quite a different expression -- not sure if it's aged in the same casks, but my guess is not. This is a very nice bottle to have. Though I do like this blend quite a lot, I don't think I'd be keen to pay £90 for it; however, for £19, it was an easy choice. This is a great whisky, though when it comes to blended Japanese 17s, I'd have to give the Hibiki 17 the nod over this one, though only just. I feel fortunate to have both in my collection."
"1044","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Complex Japanese Whisky, My Favorite To Date From Japan","Tonight's whisky was the 17 year old Nikka Taketsuru. The nose was found behind the alcohol sitting as a nice Winter pine for me. The taste gently wrapped the tongue in soft mint like notes before turning mildly peaty on the sides of my tongue. The ending allowed the soft entry to make way for a sharper finish with lingering peat like a fisherman's late October morning. More enjoyable japanese whisky than most i've had because of the complexity - whereas the yamazaki 12 or coffy, or even the hokushu 25 were ultra clean and distinct in their even balance but lacking the rolling mysteries of flavor i personally like at this stage in my drinking experience.  Maybe my favorite Japanese whisky to date."
"1045","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Nice to Sample","Sampled this as part of a tasting set. The palate is smooth, but there is a lot of alcohol on the nose and extra bite going into the finish. I was anticipating depth, but found this to be more one-note in my opinion. Glad I sampled it, but it's just not to my liking - especially given the price. I have fond memories of Japan that involve smoky bars, and similar whisky poured over perfectly carved spheres of ice. But sometimes it's the atmosphere that adds to the enjoyment of the experience... Others could disagree with my statements, but with such varied reviews, I'd recommend trying a sample first."
"1046","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Beautiful","Smooth and complex, one of my go to whiskeys."
"1047","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","Dissapointed","I've had a bottle of the Taketsuru 12 yr old and I was blown away by the quality for the price.So I was very excited to buy the 17. Sadly it was just wasn't up to snuff. Way too much alcohol on show first of all. It hit really you.The overall taste after was a little smoke and not much else. I was expecting much more."
"1048","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","damn near genius level dram","lovely, absolutely lovely. anyone who doesn't enjoy this taketsuru 17 should have their head examined."
"1049","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","tim nice but dim","Overpriced at £88 from Paris CDG Aiport duty free (funny how duty free costs more than Royal Mile at a more reasonable £78).To qualify my 'overpriced' statement, one can buy 15Y/O Springbank at around £55, and that is very very good indeed......... With this 17 y/o I could not detect even the slightest hint of smoke, absolutely zero. There is a slight prickle of peat on the tongue, only just. Predominantly its sweet, minty, bourbon oak, malteser chocolates. EXREMELY smooth, almost cloying so a single glass is more than enough.  Quite frankly I'm bemused at the ratings because I will never buy another. "
"1050","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","good, but the 21-year old is better","Similar to the 15 year old Yamazaki Sherry cask, but more smooth.Perhaps closer to the Glengoyne 17 year old.Still a bit of bite from the alcohol. Not very spicy or warm, but tasty.The 21-year old is a lot smoother and tastes 35% better in addition to being more smooth. I'm a bit torn since I do like a little alcohol bite (not entirely smooth) with this type of whisky./Joakim"
"1051","Nikka Taketsuru 17 Year Old","Nikka","My first bottle in Tokyo","I came back with three of these, 2 wrapped hopefully in the suitcase.  But the first I bought was on a free day in Tokyo.  Huge department store, and I wound my way down to where the bottles were sold.  Tasted a local Saitama whiskey. Quite good, but went with a small 180ml bottle of the Whiskey that just won best blended in the world, Nikka 17 Year Old.Wow. I now have an affection for the 180ml bottle.  It allows for wonderful smelling.  Maybe a similar action to the Whiskey Glass (to be seen, those are in the mail to me now), but all I know is that this pure malt has a sweet deep nose.  When smelling just right, one can smell it deep.  It is cherry sweet all day long.  Yes this is a great whiskey in the mouth, but the nose defines it before you need to let it touch your lips.This is high end. Get it here.  And tell everyone you know that duty free exiting Japan had this for 3500 yen (domestically this sells for approx 5400;  whereas the Hibiki 17 is 6500 duty free, 10500 domestically).No doubt, the Hibiki is incredible. But from Nikka I feel even more excited about Japanese whiskey.  The Yoichi 10 (180ml also) I just opened in California is marvelous and very drinkable. (the 15 Year Yoichi must be unreal).But the Nikka 17 might define a turning point in my life.  I wanted something great that day and I found it.  That's always a good thing.Of course, unlike the USA, it is LEGAL to drink anywhere in Japan.  So I took a goofy sample cup, and relaxed and mozied around for a few hours in a beautiful, packed area, taking in the local feel, and pouring small amounts, smelling the wonderful port like sweetness and savoring the way a  great whiskey makes your mouth feel and taste."
"1052","Nikka Taketsuru 25 Year Old","Nikka","Excellent drop!","Was in Niigata last New Years. The hotel bar had a bottle. 4620 yen a shot-outstanding whisky - was forced to have two just to be sure!"
"1053","Nikka Taketsuru 25 Year Old","Nikka","Magnificent Pure Malt","I was lucky enough to purchase this bottle on a visit to Tokyo. It was the last bottle left. I have not opened it, but the color is exquisite. And by licking the glass, I can already tell this will be a grand pour on my death bed."
"1054","Super Nikka Revival Limited Edition","Nikka","Excellent Whisky for the price.","This is an excellent summer whisky. Smooth and slightly sweet with a hint of peat. Soft enjoyable finish makes it hard to stick to two finger pours. "

"1060","Nikka Pure Malt White","Nikka","harmonic","I bought this whisky in the Warsaw duty free shop and went to the cashier. He just exclaimed ""Wow"" and thought I've made a good choice. I opened it some days later 'cause I was anxious to taste it and compare it to Connemara that I like so much.I found it proportionally smoky, quite complex, a bit fruity and with a smooth aroma.I like it a lot, a use to taste my whiskies in small glasses and take some sips. This is good stuff, just try it.I haven't found someone to go crazy with this whisky but maybe you will...?I haven't tasted the other versions of Nikka, but it maybe be Worth doing it and compare."

"1062","Nikka Pure Malt White","Nikka","Breathtaking ... Pure Malt-White-Prduct of Nikka","Fiery hot with strong peat taste, clears the nose and heats the throat ... good and strong ... look forward to trying the 'Black' label and others from this area."
"1063","Nikka Pure Malt White","Nikka","Well recommended","what a gem, medium peat and smoke, a salty and a smooth full mouthful, long briny finish, absolutely delicious. If you like Bruichladdich or Talisker then this is something you will appreciate."
"1064","Nikka Pure Malt White","Nikka","A good, solid blend.","This blend has plenty to offer. It is indeed quite peaty, as mentioned. Not quite the kick in the face you'd get from Laphroaig but certainly enough to get your nose in. There are other facets too, with plenty of sweetness and a decent finish. It may not be the world's greatest but it proves that you shouldn't overlook something just because it's not single malt."
"1065","Nikka Pure Malt White","Nikka","Laphroaig","I was given a taster set of this for christmas and the white is stunning, tarmaccy, like a laphroaig! Wonderful"
"1066","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","great","So powerful yet so smooth. Notes of caramel, coffee, peat, vanilla, chocolate"
"1067","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Perfection","I am a huge fan of the little brother (Taketsuru 17 yrs). This just appeared in my local specialist liquor store and having been voted best blended malt in the world in 2010, I just had to try it.Wow! This just slips down frighteningly easily. It has everything the 17 year old has (perfect balance between a light smokiness and sweet sherry notes, complexity and delicious soft spices) and adds another dimension in terms of richness, smoothness and extra malty, chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavour. The finish is probably the best of any whisk(e)y I've ever tried (and I have over 120 in my cabinet up to 39 years old). Unbelievably smooth with waves of complexity unfolding into layers of nutmeg and clove, malt, smoke, maybe a little eucalyptus and/or mint, some liquorice.Just WOW! So glad I bought two."
"1068","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Perfectly balanced of sweet and spice","This is the best whisky I've had to date. It's incredibly complex and well balanced, and just a real treat.I'm not sure what it was casked in, but it has a whiff of sherry about it to compliment, but then this nutty caramel sweetness that mellows into this warming  spice that just makes you smile. It's just great, and to me exactly what a whisky should be. I disagree with peaty being mentioned. For me, there's none of that. "
"1069","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","The best whisky I have ever had! ","This whisky just keeps giving and is extremely complex. Good luck getting your hands on it! "
"1070","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Outstanding Whisky ","Myself and a friend attended the Yoichi Distillery and, after tasting several including the 20 and 21 yr old, were disappointed to learn all the aged whisky was unavailable. Happily, I have just obtained 2 bottles of the excellent 21 yr old. Hint...It's a top blend and can still be found at very reasonable prices in 'out of the way' Japanese bottle shops...well worth searching for if you are in Japan! "
"1071","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Not discontinued ","Whilst there has been a restructuring of the Nikka whisky lines, thankfully the Taketsuru was not discontinued. It is the Yoichi and Miyakikyo age statement whiskies that have been discontinued. The retail price for the Taketsuru in Japan did recently go up however, and the 21 retails in department stores for approx JPY 15,000 (GBP 90). The 17 for about half that. "
"1072","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Now a collectors bottle.","I was bought a bottle of this, just before they stopped producing it. I am afraid I will never get to taste it as if you can now find a bottle, it will cost you over 1000 Euros........"
"1073","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Best Scotch ever","Bought a bottle at Narita Airport - coming home from a long stay in Korea and Sagamihara Japan. Opened the bottle on a brisk fall evening while camping in late October, just me, my 8 year old white lab, a very nice camp fire, a fine cigar, and this 21 year old bottle of scotch. Really - it does not get better than that. "
"1074","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","The End?","according to Nonjatta, Nikka's whisky lineup will only be composed of NAS bottlings-this means that from 2015 the 21 year old will be history...."
"1075","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","The pride of my collection","When i saw this at Narita airport for USD70, I thought they mislabelled it. I have about 20 bottles of whiskey at home, leaning towards the peaty. This bottle is my prized possession, which despite its price, I save only for the most special of occasions.Agree 100% with the guy with 30 bottles of whiskey. Coats the tongue beautifully, and releases mild peat, lovely caramel flavours and a citrussy twist at the end to bring a smile to your face."
"1076","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","A truly masterful blend","I was fortunate enough to pick up both the 17yo and the 21yo on a trip to Tokyo. Even there, it's not easy to come by, but for whatever reason, the prices were astoundingly low -- though limited to the purchase of one bottle only. That's fine. The 17yo was 3500 yen (£19), the 21yo was 6000 yen (£32). Meanwhile, the Yamazaki, Hibiki, and Hakushu were all fairly expensive -- presumably on account of the greater name recognition. For example, the Yamazaki 25 was a staggering 250,000 yen (£1350), and was sold out. Even the 21 was 50,000 yen, and the Hibiki 17 (which I very much like) was 20,000 yen, so the Taketsuru 21 for just 6,000 was a no-brainer. I was able to get a sample and that sealed the deal, but really, for £32, there wasn't much chance I wasn't going to buy this bottle. The shop had just gotten their stocks the previous day, I was told, after being sold out for over four months. Like they say, timing is everything.And not only was the Taketsuru 21 an amazing value, it's really just a fantastic blend. It has a smooth, pleasant viscosity when sipped neat, but adding a bit of water really develops both the nose and the flavour. There's a sherry influence I quite like (I'm a big fan of Glenfarclas, so I'm keen on sherry casks for whisky in general), and though it's hard to pinpoint what it is in the palate of the Taketsuru, there is something distinctly Asian about the whisky. It's just a lovely, lovely whisky, warm and spicy with just a hint of sweetness. It's super smooth, well-balanced, and pure pleasure to drink... truly one of my favourites, and I have close to 15 bottles of different Japanese whiskies at home."
"1077","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Smooth As Silk","This is my favorite Japanese Whisky! Nothing bad about it save that MOM is out of stock."
"1078","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Consummate scotch whiskey doctor","i was introduced this 21 yr old while visiting Yokahoma and to my surprise found it to be not only excellent in body and taste but will rival most all of the high end brands."
"1079","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Great whisky","I'm living in Japan at the moment and was lucky enough to go to the distillery/museum and picked up a bottle of this. Fantastic drink!Great tour of the distillery as well! Free entry and free taster of their 12 year, 17 year and apple wine!Sipping on a glass of it right now!"
"1080","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","utter perfection","This truly is the level Japan is at now..The nose says Japan in a glass..I could harp on all day about this..Not got a problem with the price..Just a wonderful dram....Steve Mcgiff, st.Ives Cornwall..."
"1081","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","So good I think it's the best of the month","This is truly an amazing taste, so much so that they won best whisky review of the month (<a href=""http://www.whiskeyreviews.org/best-whiskey-of-the-month-april-2014/"" rel=""nofollow"">Best whiskey of the month &#8211; April 2014</a>) on my site and in my opinion is one of the best in the world!Try it - you will not be disappointed!"
"1082","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Craftmansship at it's best","I ordered this bottle after I had a dram of the 17yo and was just expecting more.... which is what I got, except for peat, which is very pleasent. When you had the 17yo and then go over to the 21 it is blowing your feet. The 17yo is exceptional, the 21yo is outstanding. It is so smooth, fruity with oak and a hint of peat. This one is the best bottle I have ever had!"

"1085","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","It's raining now...","It's raining now, there's soft sounds of droplets tapping on the windows throughout the home. Other than the light coming from the ligthening strikes that seem to get closer, it's the only source of light entering the home from the outside. Inside, only a single candle is lit. I walk by an old and well worn leather arm chair and A small creek is made by the oak end table door as it is opened. I pull the bottle and a singular glass that stood near it. I sit, and lay the glass atop the end table an pour into it my companion for this late evening/ early morning. As she's introduced to the nights light show, she airs her sweet aroma, her passion. I make her wait, as I bite into finely rolled Cuban and set it afire. A couple of puffs and then she waits no more. The glass touches lip and tongue and this fine companion meets it's mentor. I say when she goes down, and for how long. A subtle burn, and sweetness is met with anticipation.  Another sip and she rolls around the tongue, like a mistress who knows she's only here for one thing and one thing only. Smokey and earthy, it seems my companion is a perfect match for tonight's engagement. Four pours later, the Cuban is gone, the nights storm passes, and the cork is pressed back into its home. I sit and watch the clouds outside roll through and leave with the nights wind. The candle is put to rest by moistened fingers, and the mind rolls this body into its bed. A fine end to this good night, a good night indeed."
"1086","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","Damn vigilantes!!!","A lovely hint of samurai sword thru your gizzard. After about a quarter of the bottle it will have you squinting like the little bastards that made it! I'm quite fond of this liquid lacquer, it'll get you from point A to point..well, where you'll want to knock up the old lady again! Let's not get too technical here, all in good fun. It's a good bottle, but it's somewhat over priced.  Now off to see the samurai samich maker...I'm hungry."
"1087","Nikka Taketsuru 21 Year Old","Nikka","I've got over 30 bottles of whiskey but...","... this is the one i keep for special occasions. I'm not a connoisseur by any stretch, but even serving this to unsuspecting guests with a single piece of ice, it always brings a wide smile. They actually recognise that this is something quite special. To me, it's smooth, coats your tongue beautifully, and then releases a very gradual warmth, which tastes slightly peaty and a nice balance of citrussy and caramelly flavours. I can't go more specific than that, but hopefully, you've already made up your mind by now."

"1099","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Perfection in a tinted bottle.","Everyone I have let try has always said, ""Wow, that is smoooth.""This is my idea of a perfect Japanese whisky. I taste cinnamon and creamy vanilla with a touch of smoke. Such a delight to drink. I also recently tried the Nikka  Taketsuru 17, which is again, on a level above the 12. If you can find the Nikka Taketsuru 12, but it, you won't be disappointed. "
"1100","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Nikka lured me into the world of single malts.","I was amazed. I had not touched scotch  since my late teens when I loathed it. When I was given the Nikka as a gift in a monogrammed flask at age 65, I blind tasted it. ""What is that?!"" I murmured in amazement. ""Scotch!"" was the whispered reply.""Scotch!?"" I exclaimed. ""What kind?"" I queried.  ""Nikka. Japanese."" Holy cow! What have I been missing? Of course, Nikka is not scotch as I was about to learn as I began my quest into the world of single malt whisky but I have not looked back... What a joy. I tasted a leathery, smoky quality that I now really love. I found it in Highland Park 12 as well. Then I read how the Japanese took the top prize in the Jim Murray tasting a couple of years ago with the Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013. I no longer felt disloyal to my Scottish ancestry for liking something that was not actually scotch. I'm due for another bottle now and, Oh! It's my birthday next week! Guess what you can give me for my BD darling wife... I'll put it right next to the Balvenie 12 Single Barrel and the Glenkinchie 12..."

"1102","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Delicate, light, complex, satisfying","This is as good as any Scotch I've had at this price point. It is delicate and light, but has layers and layers of complexity, including a long and subtle finish. Of the Scotches I drink, this is more like Glenmorangie than the smokier malts. But it is distinct, and very definitely has its own personality, and quite a pleasing one! We have five in stock locally, and for a change, it's priced lower in Canada than in the US. I will add at least one more bottle to my collection. "
"1103","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Delicious","My second bottle of Japanese whisky; my understanding is that the distillery from which this specific blend of cask are chosen is located in Hokkaido, the largest of the northern Japanese islands. Because of its latitude, Hokkaido shares a similar climate to Scotland, which the founder of Nikka distilleries believed was essential to producing superior whiskeys. Suntory brands, like the excellent Hibiki, are distilled on Honshu, which is the largest and most central of the Japanese Islands. The Nikka 12 Pure Malt blend is much fruiter than Hibiki 12, and has a sweeter, more round noise, with notes of vanilla and a caramelized sugars. The flavor is sweet and full, with notes of fruit and sherry, and a strong flavor of vanilla and marshmallows with delicate balance of peat which reminds me of the umami flavors in strong fermented soy sauces. However, both being Japanese whiskeys, there are many flavor notes that are similar between the two; refreshing grassy notes and milk tea, with a surprising harmony between all the flavors.   I would highly recommend this bottle as one of the growing number of excellent Japanese whiskeys. "
"1104","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Excellent Contender","I thought my favorite top five whiskeys were set in stone. But this has completely shaken up the list. The subtle peet taste, it's mild demeanor,  and light sweetness reminiscent of a fine bourbon come together in a novel way. Furthermore it costs much less than many of my other favorites whiskeys"
"1105","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Pat on the back to the Chaps","You guys couldn't have hit the nail more on the head than this fine whisky. Your tasting notes are spot on. This blend is simply amazing and deserves to be acknowledged. In my top 3 blended whisky's."
"1106","Nikka Taketsuru 12 Year Old","Nikka","Not my cup of tea","There's a unpleasant smell in it that make me cringe and the taste has a flat bitterness that reminds me of cheap stuff like 'Label 5'. Will go back to 'Majesty'. Wonderful bottlecap though."

I literally couldn't help but open it up to try and it's simply like nothing else I've ever tried. It's very bourbon'esc, lots of honeycomb and hickory with some nuttyness flying about. The taste is some complex I really struggled to pin down the specific flavour components - they're all just massive. I'm stunned. I was litterally knocked off my feet and had to sit down when I first tried this. The shop I got it from only had an allocation of 2 bottles and I suspect if I went back for the other now it would be gone :-("

"1127","Nikka 1995 Single Cask Coffey Grain","Nikka","Phenomenal. ","Given the slightly racist tone to the guy at the top there, I think we can safely ignore the rest of opinion (especially as he seems to think it's wine).
